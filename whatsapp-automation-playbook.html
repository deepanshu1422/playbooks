<h3>Day 2 - The Quick Win</h3>
<pre><code>☀️ Good morning [Name]!

Yesterday you got the guide. Today, a quick win you can implement in 10 minutes:

🎯 THE LINKEDIN REMOTE FLAG TRICK

Most people miss this:

1. Open your LinkedIn profile
2. Click &quot;Open to Work&quot;
3. Select &quot;Remote&quot; as your ONLY location
4. Make it visible to recruiters

Why? LinkedIn&#39;s algorithm shows you 3X more remote jobs when this is set.

I&#39;ve seen people get recruiter messages within 48 hours of doing this.

⏰ Go do it now → Set a timer for 10 minutes

Reply DONE when you&#39;ve updated it. I&#39;ll send you the next strategy.

- [Your Name]
</code></pre>
<h3>Day 3 - The Value Bomb</h3>
<pre><code>🔥 [Name], this one&#39;s a game-changer...

I analyzed 500+ remote job postings last month.

Here are the 3 skills that appeared in 87% of $80k+ remote roles:

1️⃣ **Async Communication** 
   → Writing clear updates without meetings
   → Tools: Notion, Loom, Slack

2️⃣ **Self-Management**
   → Hitting deadlines without supervision
   → Showing your work (not just results)

3️⃣ **Digital Collaboration**
   → Google Workspace, project management tools
   → Remote pair programming / workshops

📌 **Your action item:**
Update your resume/LinkedIn with ONE example of each skill.

Example: 
&quot;Managed cross-timezone project using Asana, delivered 2 weeks early without daily check-ins&quot;

Need help writing your examples? Reply HELP and I&#39;ll send you a template.

P.S. - Tuesday I&#39;m sharing 5 companies actively hiring remote roles. Keep an eye out 👀
</code></pre>
<h3>Day 4 - The Belief Shift</h3>
<pre><code>❓ Can I be honest with you, [Name]?

Most people lose remote jobs in the FIRST interview question:

&quot;Why do you want to work remotely?&quot;

❌ Wrong answers:
• &quot;I want flexibility&quot;
• &quot;I hate commuting&quot;
• &quot;I can travel while working&quot;

(Even if true, employers hear: &quot;You&#39;re not serious&quot;)

✅ Right answer:
&quot;Remote work allows me to structure my environment for peak productivity. I do my best work in focused blocks, and I value the accountability that comes with remote-first companies.&quot;

📺 I recorded a 4-minute video breaking down the perfect answer:
🔗 [Link to Video]

Watch it before your next interview. Could be the difference between an offer and &quot;we&#39;ll keep you in mind.&quot;

Questions? Just ask. I&#39;m here.

</code></pre>
<h3>Day 5 - Social Proof</h3>
<pre><code>💬 &quot;I got the job!&quot;

That&#39;s what Sarah messaged me last week.

She followed the exact strategy I shared with you on Day 3 (the skills framework).

Her result?
→ 3 interviews in 10 days
→ 2 offers
→ $95k remote role at a SaaS company

Here&#39;s what she did differently 👇

She stopped applying to hundreds of jobs and started:
1. Targeting 10 specific remote-first companies
2. Customizing her resume for each (5 minutes each)
3. Following up after 3 days (most people don&#39;t)

🎁 Want her exact email templates? 

Reply TEMPLATES and I&#39;ll send them over.

<h3>Day 6 - The Soft Pitch</h3>

I want to make sure you&#39;re getting what you need.

<h2>5. SALES CONVERSATION SCRIPTS</h2>
<h3>Transition Principles</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Value first, always</strong> (never pitch cold)</li>
<li><strong>Ask permission</strong> (&quot;Is it okay if I share how I can help?&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>Focus on their problem</strong>, not your features</li>
<li><strong>Natural, conversational</strong> (not salesy)</li>
<li><strong>Create urgency</strong> (scarcity, timing, results)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Script 1: After High Engagement</h3>
<p><strong>When they reply frequently, engage with content, ask questions:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Hey [Name] 👋

I&#39;ve noticed you&#39;ve been really engaged with the content I&#39;ve been sharing (love it!)

Quick question: 

Are you just gathering info, or are you seriously ready to land a remote job in the next 60-90 days?

(Just being real with you - my approach changes based on your answer 😊)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>If they say &quot;Seriously ready&quot;:</strong></p>
<pre><code>That&#39;s what I like to hear! 💪

Real talk - the free tips I share are great, but they&#39;re just the surface.

The people who actually land $60k-$120k remote jobs in 60 days? They have 3 things:

1️⃣ A proven system (not random job boards)
2️⃣ Personal guidance (not generic advice)
3️⃣ Accountability (someone to keep them on track)

That&#39;s exactly what [Program Name] gives you.

Can I send you the details? No pressure, just want you to have the info if you&#39;re serious.

Reply YES if you want me to explain what&#39;s included.
</code></pre>
<h3>Script 2: After Expressing Frustration</h3>
<p><strong>When they mention: &quot;Not getting interviews,&quot; &quot;Getting rejected,&quot; &quot;Stuck,&quot; etc.:</strong></p>
<pre><code>I hear you, [Name]. That&#39;s frustrating.

Can I ask - how long have you been trying the &quot;traditional&quot; way? (Job boards, cold applications, etc.)

[Wait for response]

Yeah, that&#39;s the problem. The traditional way has a 2-3% success rate for remote jobs.

Here&#39;s what actually works 👇

[2-3 sentences about your methodology]

I&#39;ve packaged this into a complete system: [Program Name]

It&#39;s how [X number] of people landed remote jobs in [timeframe], including [specific success story].

Would you like to hear how it works? I can explain in 2 minutes.

Reply YES or NO (seriously, no pressure either way - I just hate seeing people waste time on strategies that don&#39;t work).
</code></pre>
<h3>Script 3: After Webinar</h3>
<p><strong>[See &quot;Replay + Offer&quot; message in Section 4]</strong></p>
<p><strong>If they reply &quot;READY&quot;:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Amazing! Here&#39;s what you get in [Program Name]:

📋 **PHASE 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**

<h3>Script 4: Handling Objections</h3>
<p><strong>&quot;I need to think about it&quot;:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Totally fair, [Name].

What specifically do you need to think about?

(Sometimes talking it through helps. I&#39;m not here to pressure you - just help you make the right decision for YOUR situation.)

Is it:
A) The investment?

C) Whether it&#39;ll work for you?
D) Something else?
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Then address their specific concern:</strong></p>
<p><strong>If A (Investment):</strong></p>
<pre><code>I get it. $297 isn&#39;t nothing.

Here&#39;s how I think about it:

If you land a $70k remote job 60 days from now (that&#39;s the average for my clients), you&#39;re earning:
→ $5,833 per month
→ $1,458 per week
→ $291 per DAY

You&#39;ll make back your investment in ONE DAY of work at your new job.

Plus, I offer a 60-day guarantee. If you don&#39;t land a job, you get 100% back. Zero risk.

Also, 3-payment plan available: $109 x 3 months.

Does that help?
</code></pre>
<p><strong>If B (Timing):</strong></p>
<pre><code>When&#39;s a better time?

Here&#39;s the thing - the remote job market is hot RIGHT NOW. Companies are hiring before Q[X] ends.

Also, the program takes 60 days. If you start today, you&#39;re interviewing by [Date] and starting your new job by [Date].

If you wait, you&#39;re pushing that timeline back.

But I get it - life is busy. What&#39;s happening that makes timing bad?

[Address their specific situation]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>If C (Will it work for me):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Fair question. Let me ask:

• What industry are you in?
• Years of experience?
• Target salary range?

[Wait for response]

Perfect. Here&#39;s why this WILL work for you:

[Specific example of someone similar who succeeded]

Plus, the 60-day guarantee means you have nothing to lose.

What do you think?

In [Program Name], I include region-specific job boards and visa considerations.

</code></pre>
<p><strong>Q: &quot;I&#39;m a [beginner/career changer/etc.]. Will this work for me?&quot;</strong></p>
<pre><code>Absolutely! Here&#39;s the truth:

Remote jobs care about 3 things:
1️⃣ Can you do the work?
2️⃣ Can you communicate well remotely?
3️⃣ Can you self-manage?

Your background matters LESS than you think.

I&#39;ve helped:
• Career changers land remote roles
• Entry-level folks get $50k+ remote jobs
• Experienced pros transition to remote

That tells me one of three things:

1️⃣ You&#39;re not serious about remote work (totally fine!)
2️⃣ You&#39;re overwhelmed and don&#39;t know where to start (I can help)
3️⃣ My content isn&#39;t relevant to you (let me fix that)

Got 3 interviews in 2 weeks.

Landed a $85k remote job at a startup.

Her name&#39;s Michelle. She almost unsubscribed.

I&#39;m not saying this will happen to you. But it WON&#39;T if you check out now.
