<h1>1. WEBINAR CONVERSION OPTIMIZATION</h1>
<h2>1.1 PRE-WEBINAR STRATEGY (Build Commitment &amp; Desire)</h2>
<h3>Commitment Device #1: Pre-Webinar Homework</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Increase show rate and prime buying mindset</p>
<p><strong>Assignment Email (Send 24h before):</strong></p>
<pre><code>Subject: Your homework before tomorrow&#39;s masterclass 📋

[NAME],

You&#39;re confirmed for tomorrow&#39;s &quot;Land Your Dream Remote Job&quot; masterclass.

Before we meet, complete this 3-minute prep work so you get MAXIMUM value:

1. Write down your #1 frustration with your current job search
2. What would landing a $80K+ remote role change for you?
3. What&#39;s held you back from getting there so far?

[SUBMIT BUTTON → Simple form]

This helps me tailor the training to YOUR situation.

See you tomorrow at [TIME]!

P.S. Only 12% of people do the homework. They&#39;re the ones who land jobs fastest. Be one of them.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sunk cost fallacy (they invested time = higher show rate)</li>
<li>Self-diagnosis (they identify their own pain)</li>
<li>Primes them to be &quot;action takers&quot; vs passive learners</li>
</ul>
<h3>Commitment Device #2: Pre-Webinar Video (5 min)</h3>
<p><strong>Send 2 hours before webinar:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Subject: Watch this before we start (2h warning) ⏰

[NAME],

Quick reminder: We&#39;re live in 2 hours!

Before we start, watch this 5-minute video:
[LINK: &quot;The #1 Mistake That Keeps You From Remote Jobs&quot;]

It sets up what we&#39;ll cover today.

Join link: [WEBINAR LINK]
Starting at: [TIME] sharp

- [Your Name]

P.S. We&#39;re starting ON TIME. Late arrivals miss the breakthrough moment.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Video Content:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Quick win story (30 sec)</li>
<li>&quot;Here&#39;s what you&#39;ll learn today&quot; (2 min)</li>
<li>&quot;Come ready to take notes and ask questions&quot; (30 sec)</li>
<li>&quot;We only have limited spots for our coaching program, and they fill fast&quot; (1 min)</li>
<li>&quot;See you in 2 hours!&quot; (30 sec)</li>
</ol>
<h3>Pre-Webinar Survey (Primes Buying Mindset)</h3>
<p><strong>Send with registration confirmation:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>What&#39;s your biggest challenge with landing a remote job?</li>
<li>How much do you want to earn in your next role? ($50K / $70K / $100K+ / Not sure)</li>
<li>If you could land your dream remote job in 60 days, how would that change your life?</li>
<li>What have you already tried? (Job boards / LinkedIn / Networking / Courses / Nothing yet)</li>
<li>On a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to making this happen? (If 7+: &quot;Why that number?&quot; If &lt;7: &quot;What would make it a 10?&quot;)</li>
<li>If we had a program that guaranteed results, would you invest in yourself? (Yes, absolutely / Yes, but need to know price / Maybe / No)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Why This Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Q1: Identifies pain point for webinar personalization</li>
<li>Q2: Anchors them to income level (pre-frames value)</li>
<li>Q3: Vision casting (they sell themselves)</li>
<li>Q4: Identifies sophistication level</li>
<li>Q5: Commitment assessment</li>
<li>Q6: Pre-frames investment conversation</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scarcity Setup</h3>
<p><strong>In confirmation email:</strong></p>
<pre><code>⚠️ IMPORTANT: We only accept 8-10 new clients per month (that&#39;s all we can handle while maintaining our 94% job placement rate).

During tomorrow&#39;s masterclass, I&#39;ll share how to apply for our upcoming cohort. Spots are first-come, first-served.
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why It Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sets expectation that not everyone gets in</li>
<li>Exclusivity = higher perceived value</li>
<li>Creates urgency before they even attend</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>1.2 DURING WEBINAR STRATEGY (The Perfect Webinar Formula)</h2>
<h3>The Hook Formula (First 5 Minutes - DO OR DIE)</h3>
<p><strong>Minute 0-1: Pattern Interrupt</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Before we start, I need to tell you something that might upset you...

Everything you&#39;ve been told about landing a remote job is designed to keep you stuck.

Job boards? They&#39;re where the WORST opportunities go.
Your resume? It&#39;s getting filtered out by robots before a human even sees it.
LinkedIn applications? You&#39;re competing with 500 other people.

But here&#39;s the good news: There&#39;s a hidden job market where companies are DESPERATE to hire people like you... and 99% of job seekers don&#39;t know it exists.

That&#39;s what we&#39;re covering today. So grab a pen, turn off distractions, and let&#39;s get started.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Minute 1-3: Authority &amp; Proof</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Quick intro: I&#39;m [NAME], and over the last [X] years, I&#39;ve helped [NUMBER] professionals land remote jobs averaging $[AMOUNT] per year.

[SHOW SLIDE: Wall of student results - names, companies, salary increases]

People like [NAME], who went from retail manager to remote project manager at Google in 67 days...

And [NAME], who was unemployed for 8 months before landing a $95K remote role at [COMPANY] in just 31 days after working with us.

The best part? These aren&#39;t people with fancy degrees or tech backgrounds. They&#39;re people JUST LIKE YOU who learned the system I&#39;m sharing today.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Minute 3-5: Promise &amp; Agenda</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Here&#39;s what we&#39;re covering in the next 60 minutes:

1. The &#39;Hidden Job Market&#39; Method - how to find jobs that never get posted publicly
2. The &#39;Reverse Interview&#39; Framework - how to make companies chase YOU
3. The &#39;3-Touch Close&#39; - how to turn one conversation into multiple offers

By the end, you&#39;ll have a clear roadmap to land your dream remote job in 60 days or less.

But here&#39;s the catch: This only works if you TAKE NOTES and ASK QUESTIONS. This isn&#39;t Netflix. This is your career. Act like it.

Sound good? Drop a &#39;YES&#39; in the chat if you&#39;re ready!&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why This Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pattern interrupt captures attention</li>
<li>Authority established in 60 seconds</li>
<li>Specific results (names, numbers, timelines)</li>
<li>Clear promise with takeaways</li>
<li>Call to action (engagement)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Teaching-to-Selling Transition (The Bridge)</h3>
<p><strong>When:</strong> After 30-35 minutes of teaching</p>
<p><strong>The Bridge Script:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Okay, this is the part where things get REAL...

Everything I just showed you WORKS. You could go implement this yourself starting tomorrow.

But here&#39;s what happens when most people try:

They get excited, take notes, and then... life happens. The motivation fades. They don&#39;t know what to do first. They hit a roadblock and quit.

It&#39;s not because they&#39;re lazy. It&#39;s because they&#39;re missing THREE things:

1. A PROVEN SYSTEM (step-by-step, nothing left to chance)
2. ACCOUNTABILITY (someone making sure you actually do the work)
3. INSIDER ACCESS (introductions to hiring managers, recruiter relationships, interview prep)

That&#39;s why we created the [PROGRAM NAME].

Now, I&#39;m not going to do a hard pitch. This isn&#39;t for everyone. In fact, we only accept 8-10 people per month.

But if you&#39;re serious about making this happen - if you&#39;re DONE applying to jobs on LinkedIn and getting ghosted - I&#39;m going to share how to work with us.

First, let me show you what we do differently...&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why This Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Validates what they learned (reduces buyer&#39;s remorse later)</li>
<li>Identifies gap between knowledge and execution</li>
<li>Frames coaching as the missing piece</li>
<li>Pre-frames exclusivity</li>
<li>&quot;Not for everyone&quot; = reverse psychology</li>
</ul>
<h3>Story Placement Strategy</h3>
<p><strong>Story #1 (Minute 5-8): The Origin Story</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Why you created this system</li>
<li>Your struggle (must be relatable)</li>
<li>The breakthrough moment</li>
<li>First person you helped</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Build credibility and relatability</p>
<p><strong>Story #2 (Minute 15-18): The Method Discovery</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How you discovered the &quot;hidden job market&quot;</li>
<li>What made it different</li>
<li>First results</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Establish authority and differentiation</p>
<p><strong>Story #3 (Minute 28-32): The Transformation Story</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Recent client, similar situation to audience</li>
<li>Their specific pain points</li>
<li>The exact process they followed</li>
<li>The result + life change</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Show proof and create &quot;if they can, I can&quot; belief</p>
<p><strong>Story #4 (Minute 45-50): The Urgency Story</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A student who waited too long</li>
<li>What happened (missed opportunity, stayed stuck longer)</li>
<li>Contrast with someone who acted fast</li>
<li>&quot;Don&#39;t make the same mistake&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Create urgency without being pushy</p>
<h3>Proof Stacking Sequence</h3>
<p><strong>Testimonial Timing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Minute 10:</strong> First testimonial (credibility builder)</li>
<li><strong>Minute 20:</strong> Second testimonial (method validation)</li>
<li><strong>Minute 35:</strong> Third testimonial (objection breaker - &quot;I was skeptical too&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>Minute 50:</strong> Fourth testimonial (similar to audience)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proof Stack Elements:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Before/after income screenshots</li>
<li>Job offer letters (redacted but real)</li>
<li>LinkedIn messages from hiring managers</li>
<li>Video testimonials (20-30 sec clips)</li>
<li>Industry-specific wins (tech, marketing, finance, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Proof Slide Formula:</strong></p>
<pre><code>[PHOTO] - [NAME], [AGE], [PREVIOUS JOB]
→ Now: [CURRENT JOB] at [COMPANY]
→ Salary: $[OLD] → $[NEW] ([X]% increase)
→ Timeline: [DAYS] days
→ Quote: &quot;I almost didn&#39;t apply because I thought it was too expensive. Best investment I ever made.&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Price Reveal Psychology (The Anchor Stack)</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Value Breakdown (5 minutes before price)</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Let me break down what you&#39;re getting:

1. The Complete Remote Job System (value: $5,000)
   - 12 modules, step-by-step playbook
   - Every script, template, and framework we use

2. Private Coaching Calls (value: $8,000)
   - Weekly group coaching
   - Monthly 1-on-1 strategy sessions

3. Insider Access (value: $10,000)
   - Direct introductions to hiring managers
   - Our recruiter network (500+ relationships)
   - Interview prep with ex-hiring managers

4. Job Guarantee (value: Priceless)
   - If you don&#39;t land a role, we work with you until you do
   - No time limit, no BS

Total value: $23,000+&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 2: Anchor High</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Now, if you hired an executive career coach, you&#39;d pay $15,000-$30,000 for something LESS comprehensive than this.

If you hired a recruiter, they&#39;d take 15-20% of your first year salary. On a $100K job, that&#39;s $15,000-$20,000.

Our program delivers better results for a fraction of that.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 3: The Reveal</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;The investment for the complete program is normally $7,997.

But because you&#39;re here live today, I&#39;m giving you the Founders Rate...

For the next 24 hours, it&#39;s $4,997.

Or, if you want to spread it out: 3 payments of $1,797.

That&#39;s it. Less than you&#39;d spend on a used car, for something that will change your ENTIRE career trajectory.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Step 4: ROI Reframe</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Let&#39;s do the math:

You&#39;re probably underpaid by $20K-$40K right now compared to what you SHOULD be making remotely.

That&#39;s $20,000-$40,000 PER YEAR you&#39;re leaving on the table.

This program costs $4,997. If it gets you just $10K more per year, it pays for itself in 6 months.

But our average student gets a $32,000 salary increase.

That&#39;s a 6X return in year one. And you get that raise EVERY YEAR after.

Can you think of a better investment?&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Objection Pre-Emption (Before They Even Ask)</h3>
<p><strong>Objection #1: &quot;Does this work for my industry?&quot;</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;You might be thinking, &#39;This sounds great, but does it work for MY industry?&#39;

Fair question. Here&#39;s the truth:

We&#39;ve placed people in tech, marketing, finance, operations, HR, customer success, project management, and 30+ other fields.

[SHOW SLIDE: Industry breakdown]

The SYSTEM is the same. The tactics adapt to your industry. And we customize everything for you.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Objection #2: &quot;I don&#39;t have time.&quot;</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Another thing: Time.

&#39;I&#39;m too busy to do this right now.&#39;

I get it. But here&#39;s what I know:

This program takes 5-7 hours per week. That&#39;s ONE hour per day on weekdays, and your weekends are free.

The real question is: Do you have an hour a day to TRANSFORM your career?

Or are you going to stay stuck for another year because you&#39;re &#39;too busy?&#39;

You&#39;re busy NOW and not getting results. What if you were busy AND getting results?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Objection #3: &quot;What if it doesn&#39;t work for me?&quot;</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Finally, you might be thinking, &#39;What if I&#39;m the ONE person this doesn&#39;t work for?&#39;

Here&#39;s my guarantee:

If you show up, do the work, and don&#39;t land a job... we keep working with you until you do. No expiration date.

I can offer that because our job placement rate is 94%. When people follow the system, they get results.

The only way you fail is if you quit. And we don&#39;t let you quit.&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Urgency &amp; Scarcity Layering</h3>
<p><strong>Layer 1: Time-Sensitive Bonuses</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;If you enroll in the next 24 hours, you get:

BONUS #1: Resume &amp; LinkedIn Teardown (normally $497) - FREE
BONUS #2: Salary Negotiation Masterclass (normally $297) - FREE
BONUS #3: 100 Email Templates for Outreach (normally $197) - FREE

Total bonus value: $991

These go away at midnight tomorrow.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Layer 2: Spot Scarcity</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;We only accept 8-10 new students per month. That&#39;s it.

Right now, we have 6 spots left for the March cohort.

If those fill up today, the next available cohort is May (8 weeks from now).

That means you could land your job 2 months earlier if you act today vs waiting.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Layer 3: Competitive Pressure</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Last time we did this webinar, all 10 spots filled in 14 hours.

I&#39;m not saying that to pressure you. I&#39;m saying it because I don&#39;t want you to miss out because you were &#39;thinking about it&#39; while everyone else applied.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Layer 4: Emotional Urgency</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Here&#39;s the question you need to ask yourself:

How much longer are you willing to stay stuck?

Another month? Another year?

Every day you wait is another day you&#39;re underpaid, overworked, and frustrated.

The best time to start was yesterday. The second best time is RIGHT NOW.&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>CTA Repetition (7 Times Minimum)</h3>
<p><strong>CTA #1 (Minute 40 - Soft CTA):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;If you&#39;re already sold and want to apply, the link is in the chat. We&#39;ll review applications and reach out to qualified candidates.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>CTA #2 (Minute 45 - After testimonial):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;If you want results like [NAME], the application link is in the chat. Takes 2 minutes to fill out.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>CTA #3 (Minute 50 - After price reveal):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;To enroll, click the link in the chat and complete your application. We&#39;ll review it and reach out within 2 hours if approved.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>CTA #4 (Minute 55 - Urgency CTA):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Remember: Bonuses expire at midnight tomorrow, and we only have 6 spots left. If you&#39;re serious, apply now.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>CTA #5 (Minute 58 - Final CTA before Q&amp;A):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Last chance before Q&amp;A: If you want in, apply now. Link is in the chat and pinned at the top.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>CTA #6 (During Q&amp;A - Assumptive):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Great question. And if you were in the program, we&#39;d walk you through exactly how to handle that. That&#39;s the kind of thing we cover in week 3. Apply if you want that level of detail.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>CTA #7 (Final close - 5 minutes left):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Alright, we&#39;re wrapping up. If you haven&#39;t applied yet and you KNOW you need this, don&#39;t leave without applying.

I promise you: 6 months from now, you&#39;ll either wish you had started today, or you&#39;ll be GLAD you did.

Which do you want?&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Chat Engagement Tactics</h3>
<p><strong>Every 7-10 Minutes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Type &#39;YES&#39; if this makes sense!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Drop a 🔥 if you&#39;ve experienced this!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What&#39;s YOUR biggest challenge? Drop it in the chat!&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plant Team Members:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have 2-3 team members post positive comments</li>
<li>&quot;This is gold 💎&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Just applied! So excited!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;This is exactly what I needed to hear&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Answer Questions in Real-Time:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Great question [NAME]! Here&#39;s the answer...&quot;</li>
<li>Makes it feel interactive and personal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Call Out Locations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I see we have people from California, Texas, New York... where are YOU tuning in from?&quot;</li>
<li>Creates community feel</li>
</ul>
<h3>Q&amp;A Closing Techniques</h3>
<p><strong>Question Framework:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Q: &quot;How long does the program take?&quot;

A: &quot;Great question. The program is 8 weeks, but most students land jobs in 45-60 days.

The real question is: Would you rather spend 8 weeks following a proven system, or 6+ months doing what you&#39;re doing now and staying stuck?

If you&#39;re ready to make that commitment, apply now and let&#39;s get started.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Turn Every Question Into a Close:</strong></p>
<p>Q: &quot;Do you help with resumes?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Absolutely. We rebuild your entire resume from scratch using the frameworks that actually get interviews. That&#39;s week 1. If you want that, apply now.&quot;</p>
<p>Q: &quot;What if I&#39;m in a different time zone?&quot;<br>A: &quot;No problem - we have students in 12 countries. Calls are recorded. If you can commit 5-7 hours per week on YOUR schedule, it works. Apply and we&#39;ll discuss logistics.&quot;</p>
<p>Q: &quot;Is there a money-back guarantee?&quot;<br>A: &quot;Better. If you don&#39;t land a job, we keep working with you until you do. No refunds because we don&#39;t need them - our placement rate is 94%. Apply if you&#39;re serious.&quot;</p>

<h2>2.2 CALL STRUCTURE (60-90 Minutes)</h2>
<h3>PHASE 1: Rapport Building (10 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Build trust, establish authority, set frame</p>
<p><strong>Opening Script:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Hey [NAME]! Great to meet you. How are you doing?&quot;

[Small talk: 1-2 minutes]

&quot;Awesome. So, I had a chance to review your application, and I&#39;m excited to dive in.

Here&#39;s how we&#39;ll use our time today:

First, I&#39;m going to ask you some questions to understand exactly where you are and what you need.

Then, I&#39;ll share how our program works and whether I think it&#39;s a good fit for you.

Finally, if it makes sense for both of us, we&#39;ll talk about next steps.

Sound good?&quot;

[Wait for confirmation]

&quot;Perfect. Before we jump in, I want to set one expectation:

I&#39;m going to be direct with you. If I think you&#39;re a good fit, I&#39;ll tell you. If I don&#39;t think this will work for you, I&#39;ll tell you that too.

I&#39;m not here to convince you of anything. My job is to figure out if we can help you, and if we can, show you how.

Does that work for you?&quot;

[Wait for agreement - this is crucial]

&quot;Great. Let&#39;s get started.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why This Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Professional but friendly</li>
<li>Clear agenda (reduces anxiety)</li>
<li>Sets frame: YOU decide if they&#39;re a fit (not them deciding on you)</li>
<li>Direct = builds trust</li>
<li>Gets micro-commitment upfront</li>
</ul>
<h3>PHASE 2: Discovery Questions (15-20 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Uncover pain, identify gaps, build urgency</p>
<p><strong>The SPIN Framework:</strong></p>
<p><strong>SITUATION Questions (Current State):</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Walk me through what your job search looks like right now. What have you been doing?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;How long have you been looking?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;How many applications have you sent out? How many interviews?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What kind of roles are you targeting?&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>PROBLEM Questions (Pain Points):</strong><br>5. &quot;What&#39;s been the most frustrating part of this process?&quot;<br>6. &quot;Why do you think you&#39;re not getting the results you want?&quot;<br>7. &quot;What&#39;s held you back from landing a remote role so far?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>IMPLICATION Questions (Amplify Pain):</strong><br>8. &quot;How is this affecting your life? Your finances? Your relationships?&quot;<br>9. &quot;If nothing changes in the next 6 months, where will you be?&quot;<br>10. &quot;What&#39;s the cost of staying stuck - not just money, but time, stress, opportunity?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>NEED-PAYOFF Questions (Create Desire):</strong><br>11. &quot;If you could land your dream remote job in 60 days, how would that change things?&quot;<br>12. &quot;What would it be worth to you to never have to send another LinkedIn application again?&quot;<br>13. &quot;If I could show you a proven system that gets results, would you be interested?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Advanced Discovery Techniques:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Layered Pain Discovery:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;So you&#39;ve been applying for 6 months and only got 2 interviews. Tell me more about that...&quot;

[They explain]

&quot;That must be frustrating. What&#39;s that been like for you emotionally?&quot;

[They share feelings]

&quot;I can imagine. And how is that affecting your family? Your partner?&quot;

[They go deeper]

&quot;Got it. So it&#39;s not just about the job - it&#39;s about your confidence, your financial security, your future...&quot;

[They&#39;re now fully feeling the pain]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The &quot;Why&quot; Ladder:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Prospect: &quot;I want a remote job.&quot;

You: &quot;Why is that important to you?&quot;

Prospect: &quot;I want flexibility.&quot;

You: &quot;Why do you want flexibility?&quot;

Prospect: &quot;So I can spend more time with my kids.&quot;

You: &quot;Why is that important?&quot;

Prospect: &quot;Because I missed my daughter&#39;s first steps last month and I don&#39;t want to miss any more moments.&quot;

[NOW you have the real motivation]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Taking Notes (Do This Out Loud):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Okay, let me make sure I got this right...&quot;

[Repeat back their pain points]

&quot;Did I miss anything?&quot;

[Wait for confirmation]

&quot;Perfect. So if we can solve [PAIN #1], [PAIN #2], and [PAIN #3], you&#39;d be happy?&quot;

[Get their YES - this is crucial for the close later]
</code></pre>
<h3>PHASE 3: Vision Casting (10 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Paint the future state, create emotional buy-in</p>
<p><strong>The Vision Script:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Okay, I want you to imagine something with me...

It&#39;s 60 days from now.

You wake up in the morning, and instead of dreading your commute or hating your job, you walk to your home office.

You log into your laptop, and you&#39;re working for a company that values you, pays you $[THEIR TARGET INCOME], and gives you the flexibility you&#39;ve been craving.

You take a lunch break and actually spend time with [THEIR FAMILY/MOTIVATION FROM DISCOVERY].

At 5 PM, you close your laptop and your work is DONE. No taking it home. No weekend emails.

And at the end of the month, you look at your bank account and realize you just earned more than you&#39;ve ever earned before.

How does that feel?&quot;

[Let them sit in it for 3-5 seconds]

&quot;That&#39;s what we&#39;re going to build together. That&#39;s what&#39;s possible when you have the right system.

Now, let me show you how we get you there...&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Why Vision Casting Works:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Engages emotional brain (not logical)</li>
<li>Makes the future feel REAL</li>
<li>Uses their own words/motivations (from discovery)</li>
<li>Creates desire that overrides price objections</li>
</ul>
<h3>PHASE 4: Solution Presentation (15 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Show how your program solves their specific problems</p>
<p><strong>The Framework:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Based on what you told me, here&#39;s what&#39;s not working:

Problem #1: [Their issue]
Problem #2: [Their issue]
Problem #3: [Their issue]

The reason you&#39;re stuck isn&#39;t because you&#39;re not trying hard enough. It&#39;s because you don&#39;t have the right SYSTEM.

Here&#39;s what we do differently...&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Three Pillars (Adjust to your actual program):</strong></p>
<p><strong>Pillar #1: The Remote Job System</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;First, we give you the complete step-by-step system.

This isn&#39;t theory. This is the EXACT process our students use to land jobs.

You&#39;ll get:
- The Hidden Job Market Method (how to find jobs that never get posted)
- The Reverse Interview Framework (how to make companies chase you)
- The 3-Touch Close (how to turn one conversation into multiple offers)

Everything is done-for-you. Scripts, templates, frameworks. You just follow the playbook.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Pillar #2: Coaching &amp; Accountability</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Second, you get direct access to me and my team.

We meet weekly on group coaching calls where we review your progress, troubleshoot issues, and make sure you&#39;re on track.

Plus, you get monthly 1-on-1 strategy sessions where we customize everything for YOUR situation.

This is the accountability piece. Most people fail not because the system doesn&#39;t work, but because they don&#39;t do the work. We make sure you do the work.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Pillar #3: Insider Access</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Third - and this is the game-changer - you get insider access.

We have relationships with 500+ recruiters and hiring managers.

When you&#39;re ready, we make direct introductions. No applications. No waiting. Direct conversations with decision-makers.

This is how our students land jobs so fast. They&#39;re not competing with 500 people on LinkedIn. They&#39;re getting referrals from us.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Proof Stack During Presentation:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;For example, [STUDENT NAME] was in your exact position 3 months ago. [Brief story matching their situation].

After working with us for 6 weeks, they landed a $[AMOUNT] remote role at [COMPANY].

Here&#39;s what they said: [Play 20-second video testimonial or read quote]&quot;

[Show 2-3 relevant case studies]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Guarantee:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Now, here&#39;s what makes this risk-free:

If you show up, do the work, and don&#39;t land a job... we keep working with you until you do. No time limit. No expiration.

I can offer that because 94% of our students who follow the system get hired.

The only way you fail is if you quit. And we don&#39;t let you quit.&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>PHASE 5: Objection Handling (20 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>See Section 4 for complete objection scripts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Trial Close #1 (After Solution Presentation):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Based on what I just shared, on a scale of 1-10, how excited are you about this?&quot;

[If 8+: Move to close]
[If 5-7: &quot;What would make it a 10?&quot; → Handle objections]
[If &lt;5: &quot;Sounds like this might not be for you. What&#39;s your concern?&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Gap Close:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;So let me ask you: Do you believe this system works?&quot;

[Usually YES - you showed proof]

&quot;And do you believe it could work for YOU?&quot;

[If no: Handle belief objection]
[If yes: Continue]

&quot;So what&#39;s the gap between knowing it works and saying yes today?&quot;

[They reveal the REAL objection - handle it]
</code></pre>
<h3>PHASE 6: The Close (10 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Assumptive Close (Primary Strategy):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Alright [NAME], based on everything we discussed, I think you&#39;re a great fit.

Here&#39;s what happens next:

As soon as we get off this call, I&#39;ll send you your onboarding email with login credentials.

Your start date is [DATE] - that&#39;s when we kick off with our first group coaching call.

Before then, you&#39;ll get access to the portal so you can start going through Module 1.

Your first 1-on-1 with me is scheduled for [DATE].

The investment is [PRICE], and you can do that in one payment or split it into 3 payments of [AMOUNT].

Which works better for you?&quot;

[SHUT UP AND WAIT]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>If They Hesitate:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;What&#39;s your concern?&quot;

[Handle objection - see Section 4]

&quot;Does that make sense?&quot;

[Get agreement]

&quot;So are you ready to get started?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Payment Options Close:</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;We have two options:

Option 1: Pay in full today - $4,997
Option 2: Three payments - $1,797 each

Most people do the payment plan because it&#39;s easier on cash flow. Which do you prefer?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>The Takeaway Close (If Needed):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;[NAME], let me be honest with you...

I don&#39;t think you&#39;re ready for this.

It sounds like you&#39;re still in information-gathering mode, and that&#39;s fine. But this program is for people who are DONE playing small and ready to invest in themselves.

If that&#39;s not you right now, no worries. But I don&#39;t want to waste your time or mine.&quot;

[60% of the time, they&#39;ll fight to stay in]

&quot;Wait, no - I AM ready. I just...&quot;

[Handle their objection and close]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Final Close (Last Attempt):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Okay, let me ask you one last question:

Six months from now, you&#39;re either going to wish you had started today... or you&#39;re going to be GLAD you did.

Which do you want?&quot;

[Silence]

&quot;Let&#39;s get you started. One payment or three?&quot;

<h3>Day 1: Objection-Handling Email (Cost, Time, Skepticism)</h3>
<p><strong>Email #2:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Subject: &quot;I can&#39;t afford it&quot; (here&#39;s the truth) 💰

[NAME],

I get it. You&#39;re thinking:

&quot;This sounds great, but I can&#39;t afford $5,000 right now.&quot;

Let me reframe that for you:

You can&#39;t afford NOT to invest in yourself.

Here&#39;s the math:

Right now, you&#39;re probably underpaid by $20K-$40K compared to what you SHOULD be making in a remote role.

That&#39;s $20,000-$40,000 PER YEAR you&#39;re leaving on the table by staying stuck.

This program costs $4,997.

If it gets you just $10K more per year, it pays for itself in 6 months.

But our average student gets a $32,000 salary increase.

That&#39;s a 6X return in year one. And you get that raise EVERY YEAR after.

Plus, we have payment plans: 3 payments of $1,797.

That&#39;s $599/month for 3 months.

You probably spend more than that on things that DON&#39;T change your life.

Here&#39;s the question:

Can you afford to stay stuck for another year because you were &quot;waiting for the right time&quot;?

The bonuses expire tonight at midnight. We have 3 spots left.

<h3>Day 2: Case Study Email (Someone Like Them Who Succeeded)</h3>
<p><strong>Email #3:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Subject: How [NAME] went from $45K → $87K in 52 days 📈

[NAME],

I want to tell you about Sarah.

3 months ago, Sarah was in your EXACT position.

She had been applying to remote jobs for 7 months. Sent 400+ applications. Got 3 interviews. Zero offers.

She was burnt out, frustrated, and starting to think remote work &quot;wasn&#39;t for her.&quot;

Then she joined our program.

Here&#39;s what happened:

Week 1: We rebuilt her entire resume and LinkedIn using our frameworks
Week 2: She started using the Hidden Job Market Method
Week 3: She had 4 conversations with hiring managers (no applications - direct intros from us)
Week 5: She got her first offer: $73K remote role at a tech startup
Week 7: She got a SECOND offer: $87K at a SaaS company

She took the $87K role.

That&#39;s a $42,000 salary increase from her previous job.

Her investment: $4,997
Her return in year one: $42,000
ROI: 8.4X

But here&#39;s what Sarah told me on our last call:

&quot;The money is great. But what I&#39;m most grateful for is getting my LIFE back. I have dinner with my kids every night now. I don&#39;t commute 2 hours a day. I&#39;m not stressed all the time.

<h3>Day 3: Last Chance Urgency (Spots, Bonuses, Price Increase)</h3>
<p><strong>Email #4:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Subject: Last call (cohort closing tonight) ⏰

[NAME],

This is it.

Tonight at midnight, we&#39;re closing enrollment for the March cohort.

Right now, we have 1 spot left.

After tonight:
- The bonuses are gone
- The Founders Rate ($4,997) goes back to $7,997
- The next available cohort is May (8 weeks from now)

That means if you wait, you&#39;re potentially delaying your dream job by 2+ months.

Here&#39;s what I want you to ask yourself:

&quot;Am I going to look back 6 months from now and wish I had started today?&quot;

Or...

&quot;Am I going to be GLAD I took action when I had the chance?&quot;

The difference between those two futures is the decision you make in the next 12 hours.

→ APPLY NOW (last spot): [LINK]

I hope to see you inside.

Hey [NAME],

Just wanted to follow up on your application.

You&#39;re approved and your spot is reserved... but I need to know if you&#39;re still interested.

We had 2 more people enroll yesterday, which means we&#39;re down to 1 spot left for March.

<h3>Day 2: Payment Plan Options</h3>
<p><strong>Email #3:</strong></p>
<pre><code>Subject: Payment plans available (easier than you think) 💳

[NAME],

I&#39;m guessing the reason you haven&#39;t enrolled yet is the price.

Totally get it. $4,997 is a big investment.

But here&#39;s what most people don&#39;t realize:

You don&#39;t have to pay it all at once.

We have payment plans:

Option 1: 3 payments of $1,797 (standard)
Option 2: 6 payments of $997 (extended plan - special approval required)

Option 2 is $997/month for 6 months.

That&#39;s $33/day.

You probably spend more than that on coffee and lunch.

And in exchange, you get a system that will increase your income by $20K-$40K+ per year.

Still interested? Enroll here: [LINK]

[NAME],

Okay, I&#39;m going to level with you.

The March cohort is full. Your spot was given to someone else yesterday.

But I don&#39;t want you to miss out entirely.

Here are your options:

OPTION 1: Join the May cohort (starts May 5th)
- Same program, same price
- 8 weeks from now
- Apply here: [LINK]

OPTION 2: Join the DIY tier (starts immediately)
- Self-paced system, monthly group calls

OPTION 3: Wait and stay stuck

I hope you choose Option 1 or 2.

But if not, I wish you the best of luck with your job search.

<h1>4. OBJECTION HANDLING MASTERY</h1>
<h2>The Framework</h2>
<p>For every objection:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Acknowledge</strong> (don&#39;t dismiss their concern)</li>
<li><strong>Isolate</strong> (make sure it&#39;s the ONLY concern)</li>
<li><strong>Reframe</strong> (flip the objection)</li>
<li><strong>Proof</strong> (back it up with evidence)</li>
<li><strong>Close</strong> (ask for the sale)</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>OBJECTION #1: &quot;I can&#39;t afford it&quot;</h2>
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t see the value (yet)</li>
<li>Don&#39;t have cash available</li>
<li>Fear of wasting money</li>
<li>Previous bad investments</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reframe Script:</h3>
<p><strong>Version A (ROI Focus):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I totally understand. And here&#39;s why I&#39;m glad you brought that up.

The way I see it, you can&#39;t afford NOT to invest in yourself.

Right now, you&#39;re probably underpaid by $20K-$40K compared to what you SHOULD be making in a remote role. That&#39;s $20,000-$40,000 PER YEAR you&#39;re leaving on the table.

This program costs $4,997. If it gets you just a $10K raise, it pays for itself in 6 months. But our average student gets a $32,000 salary increase.

That&#39;s a 6X return in year one. And you get that raise EVERY YEAR after.

Can you think of a better investment?

Let me ask you: If you KNEW this would get you a $30K raise, would you find a way to make it work?&quot;

[If yes: &quot;Great! Let&#39;s figure out how to make it work. We have payment plans...&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Version B (Cost of Inaction):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I hear you. And let me ask you this:

What&#39;s the cost of NOT investing?

If you stay stuck for another year doing what you&#39;re doing now, how much money did you just lose?

Not just in salary, but in opportunity cost, stress, time with your family...

Most people spend more money on things that DON&#39;T change their lives - Netflix, eating out, random Amazon purchases - than they do on things that actually create results.

This isn&#39;t an expense. It&#39;s an investment in your future.

And we have payment plans: $1,797 for 3 months. That&#39;s $599/month.

Can you find $20/day to transform your career?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Version C (Payment Plan):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I get it. $5,000 is a big number.

But here&#39;s the thing: You don&#39;t have to pay it all at once.

We have payment plans. Three payments of $1,797.

That&#39;s $1,797 today, $1,797 in 30 days, and $1,797 in 60 days.

By the time you make your third payment, you&#39;ll probably already have job offers.

Does that make it more manageable?&quot;

[If still hesitant: &quot;What if I could get you approved for a 6-month plan? That&#39;s $997/month. Would that work?&quot;]
</code></pre>
<h3>Proof Element:</h3>
<p>&quot;Let me tell you about [NAME]. They had the same concern. They were on a tight budget. But they made it work with a payment plan. </p>
<p>Within 6 weeks, they landed a $85K remote role - a $35K increase from their previous job. </p>
<p>Now they&#39;re making MORE per month than the entire program cost. </p>
<p>Best decision they ever made.&quot;</p>
<h3>Close:</h3>
<p>&quot;So let&#39;s get you set up. Would you prefer one payment or three?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>OBJECTION #2: &quot;I need to think about it&quot;</h2>
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoiding decision (fear)</li>
<li>Needs to justify to someone else</li>
<li>Not urgent enough</li>
<li>Unclear on value</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reframe Script:</h3>
<p><strong>Version A (Direct):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I appreciate that. And can I be honest with you?

&#39;I need to think about it&#39; usually means one of two things:

Either you&#39;re not sure this is the right fit, or there&#39;s something specific holding you back.

Which one is it for you?&quot;

[They reveal the real objection - handle that instead]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Version B (Urgency Flip):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I totally understand. And here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned:

The people who &#39;think about it&#39; usually don&#39;t do it.

Not because they don&#39;t want to, but because life gets in the way. The motivation fades. They get distracted.

Then 6 months go by and they&#39;re STILL in the same place they are today.

Meanwhile, the people who say &#39;Let&#39;s do this&#39; are already landing jobs.

So let me ask you: What&#39;s there to think about?

Do you believe this system works? [Yes]
Do you believe it could work for you? [Yes]
Do you believe you need help with your job search? [Yes]

So what&#39;s the gap?&quot;

[They reveal the real objection]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Version C (Assumptive):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Sure, I get it. And while you&#39;re thinking about it, let me ask you this:

If you were going to move forward, would you prefer one payment or three?

[Forces them to mentally visualize buying]

And would you want to start in the March cohort or May cohort?

[Creates specificity]

See, the decision isn&#39;t WHETHER to do this. It&#39;s WHEN. And the best time is always now.&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Proof Element:</h3>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what happens to most people who &#39;think about it.&#39;</p>
<p>They stay stuck.</p>
<p>Last month, someone told me they needed to think about it. I said no problem.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, they reached out and said they were ready. But by then, the cohort was full and the bonuses were gone.</p>
<p>They had to wait 6 more weeks to start. Meanwhile, the people who enrolled right away already had job offers.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t let overthinking cost you 2 months of progress.&quot;</p>
<h3>Close:</h3>
<p>&quot;Look, here&#39;s the truth: You either want this or you don&#39;t. If you don&#39;t, that&#39;s fine. But if you do, let&#39;s stop overthinking and get you started. </p>
<p>One payment or three?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>OBJECTION #3: &quot;I need to talk to my spouse&quot;</h2>
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Real (they actually need approval)</li>
<li>Avoidance tactic (using spouse as excuse)</li>
<li>Fear of conflict</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reframe Script:</h3>
<p><strong>Version A (Real - Partner Involvement):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Absolutely. I totally respect that.

Here&#39;s what I&#39;d suggest:

Let&#39;s get them on the phone right now. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions they have.

Or, if that doesn&#39;t work, here&#39;s what you can tell them:

&#39;I found a program that will help me land a $70K-$120K remote job in the next 60 days. The investment is $4,997, but it will pay for itself in 6 months with the salary increase. They have a job guarantee - if it doesn&#39;t work, they keep working with me until it does.&#39;

If they&#39;re supportive of your career, they&#39;ll say yes.

And honestly, if they&#39;re NOT supportive of you investing in yourself, that&#39;s a bigger problem than the money.

What do you think they&#39;ll say?&quot;

[If positive: &quot;Great! Go talk to them and let me know. I&#39;ll hold your spot for 24 hours.&quot;]
[If unsure: &quot;What would help them say yes? If I could provide X, would that help?&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Version B (Avoidance Tactic - Call It Out):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I hear you. And can I ask you something?

If your spouse said YES right now, would YOU want to do this?&quot;

[If YES: &quot;Great! So it sounds like you&#39;re already sold. This is just about getting them on board. Let&#39;s figure out how to make that happen.&quot;]

[If NO: &quot;Okay, so it&#39;s not really about your spouse. What&#39;s YOUR hesitation?&quot; → Handle real objection]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Version C (Flip the Script):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I respect that. Marriage is a partnership.

But let me ask you this:

If you DON&#39;T invest in yourself and you&#39;re still stuck in 6 months, how will your spouse feel?

Probably frustrated, right?

Now imagine you DO invest, and 60 days from now you land a $90K remote job. How will they feel then?

Probably pretty happy, right?

The question isn&#39;t &#39;Will they support me?&#39; It&#39;s &#39;Which outcome do we both want?&#39;

Go have that conversation. I&#39;ll hold your spot for 24 hours. But after that, I have to give it to the next person.&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Proof Element:</h3>
<p>&quot;I had a student, Jessica, who said the same thing. </p>
<p>She talked to her husband, and he was skeptical. He thought it was a scam.</p>
<p>So I got on a call with both of them. Answered all his questions. Showed him the proof.</p>
<p>He said, &#39;Okay, let&#39;s do it.&#39;</p>
<p>Two months later, Jessica landed a $92K remote role. Her husband called me and said, &#39;Thank you for pushing her to do this. This changed our lives.&#39;</p>
<p>Would it help if I talked to your spouse?&quot;</p>
<h3>Close:</h3>
<p>&quot;Here&#39;s what I&#39;ll do: I&#39;ll hold your spot for 24 hours. Go talk to them tonight and let me know tomorrow. </p>
<p>But if I don&#39;t hear from you by tomorrow at [TIME], I have to give it to the next person. We have a waitlist.</p>
<p>Sound fair?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>OBJECTION #4: &quot;I don&#39;t have time right now&quot;</h2>
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Actually busy (real)</li>
<li>Overwhelmed (mental bandwidth issue)</li>
<li>Prioritization (doesn&#39;t see urgency)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reframe Script:</h3>
<p><strong>Version A (Time Reframe):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I totally get it. You&#39;re busy. Everyone is.

But here&#39;s what I know:

You&#39;re busy RIGHT NOW and not getting results, right?

What if you could be busy AND getting results?

This program takes 5-7 hours per week. That&#39;s one hour per day on weekdays. Your weekends are free.

You&#39;re probably spending MORE than that right now scrolling LinkedIn, applying to jobs, and getting ghosted.

The difference is, with our system, those 5-7 hours actually WORK.

So the real question is: Do you have one hour per day to transform your career?

Or are you going to stay stuck for another year because you&#39;re &#39;too busy?&#39;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Version B (Cost of Waiting):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I hear you. And let me ask you this:

If you wait until you have &#39;more time,&#39; when will that be?

Next month? Next quarter?

Here&#39;s what happens: You wait, and 3 months go by, and you&#39;re STILL in the same place.

Meanwhile, you&#39;ve lost 3 months of salary at your new job.

If your new job pays $30K more per year, that&#39;s $7,500 you just lost by waiting 3 months.

That&#39;s more than the program costs.

So really, you can&#39;t afford to WAIT.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Version C (Priority Flip):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I respect that. But can I challenge you on something?

You don&#39;t have a time problem. You have a priority problem.

If your doctor called and said &#39;You need surgery next week,&#39; you&#39;d find the time, right?

If your kid&#39;s school called and said &#39;We need to meet this week,&#39; you&#39;d make it happen.

This is your CAREER. Your INCOME. Your FUTURE.

If that&#39;s not a priority, what is?

The people who succeed are the ones who make it a priority. The people who stay stuck are the ones who say &#39;I&#39;ll do it later.&#39;

Which one are you?&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Proof Element:</h3>
<p>&quot;I had a student, Marcus, who was working 60-hour weeks at his current job.</p>
<p>He told me, &#39;I don&#39;t have time for this.&#39;</p>
<p>I said, &#39;That&#39;s exactly WHY you need this. You&#39;re overworked and underpaid.&#39;</p>
<p>He committed to 1 hour per day. That&#39;s it.</p>
<p>Eight weeks later, he had a $95K remote job with BETTER hours and more flexibility.</p>
<p>Now he has MORE time than he did before.</p>
<p>If he can do it, you can too.&quot;</p>
<h3>Close:</h3>
<p>&quot;Look, here&#39;s the bottom line: If you don&#39;t make time to fix this now, you&#39;ll be stuck in the same place a year from now.</p>
<p>One hour per day for 8 weeks. That&#39;s the commitment.</p>
<p>Can you do that?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>OBJECTION #5: &quot;Will this really work for me?&quot;</h2>
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Previous failures (been burned before)</li>
<li>Unique situation belief (&quot;I&#39;m different&quot;)</li>
<li>Self-doubt (&quot;I&#39;m not good enough&quot;)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reframe Script:</h3>
<p><strong>Version A (Industry/Background Concern):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Great question. And I&#39;m glad you asked.

What&#39;s your concern specifically? Is it your industry, your background, your experience level?

[They explain]

Got it. Let me show you something.

[Pull up case study of someone similar]

This is [NAME]. They had [SIMILAR SITUATION]. They thought the same thing - &#39;Will this work for me?&#39;

Here&#39;s what happened: [Result].

We&#39;ve placed people in tech, marketing, finance, operations, customer success, and 30+ other fields.

The SYSTEM is the same. The tactics adapt to your industry. And we customize everything for you.

So yes, it will work for you. IF you follow the system.

The question isn&#39;t &#39;Will it work?&#39; It&#39;s &#39;Will you DO the work?&#39;&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Version B (Previous Failures):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I hear you. And I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ve tried other programs or coaches before and it didn&#39;t work.

Let me ask you: What did you try, and why didn&#39;t it work?&quot;

[They explain]

&quot;Got it. Here&#39;s the difference:

Most programs give you information and then leave you to figure it out.

We give you a SYSTEM, accountability, and insider access.

You&#39;re not doing this alone. We&#39;re doing it WITH you.

And if you get stuck, we troubleshoot. If you&#39;re not getting results, we adjust.

That&#39;s why our job placement rate is 94%. We don&#39;t quit until you succeed.

Does that make sense?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Version C (Self-Doubt):</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I hear that a lot. &#39;I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m good enough.&#39;

Here&#39;s the truth:

It&#39;s not about being &#39;good enough.&#39; It&#39;s about having the right SYSTEM.

Our students aren&#39;t special. They don&#39;t have fancy degrees or tech backgrounds.

They&#39;re regular people who were stuck, just like you.

The difference is, they had a proven process to follow.

You know what&#39;s funny? The people who doubt themselves the most are usually the ones who succeed the fastest.

Because they&#39;re humble, coachable, and willing to do the work.

That sounds like you.

So stop doubting yourself and let&#39;s get you started.&quot;

<h3>Proof Element:</h3>
<p>&quot;Let me tell you about [NAME]. They said the EXACT same thing.</p>
<p>&#39;I don&#39;t have the right background. I don&#39;t have a college degree. I&#39;m too old. I&#39;m changing careers.&#39;</p>
<p>They almost didn&#39;t apply because they thought they weren&#39;t a good fit.</p>
<p>But they took a chance. And 9 weeks later, they landed a $78K remote role.</p>
<p>You know what they told me? &#39;I almost let my own doubt stop me from changing my life.&#39;</p>
<p>Don&#39;t make that mistake.&quot;</p>
<h3>Close:</h3>
<p>&quot;Look, you can doubt yourself, or you can trust the process.</p>
<p>Our job placement rate is 94%. That means if you do the work, you WILL get hired.</p>
<p>The only question is: Are you willing to bet on yourself?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get started. One payment or three?&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>OBJECTION #6: &quot;I&#39;ve tried other programs before&quot;</h2>
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Skepticism (been burned)</li>
<li>Comparison shopping</li>
<li>Wants to know what&#39;s different</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reframe Script:</h3>
<pre><code>&quot;I&#39;m glad you brought that up. That means you&#39;re serious about this.

Let me ask: What program did you try, and what happened?&quot;

[They explain]

&quot;Got it. And I&#39;m sorry that didn&#39;t work out.

Here&#39;s what makes us different:

Most programs give you INFORMATION. We give you a SYSTEM.

Information is &#39;Here&#39;s how LinkedIn works.&#39; A system is &#39;Here are the 7 steps, do them in this order, here are the scripts, and we&#39;ll check your work.&#39;

Most programs leave you alone after you buy. We work WITH you until you get hired.

Most programs don&#39;t have insider access. We have relationships with 500+ recruiters and hiring managers who we introduce you to directly.

And most importantly: We have a job guarantee. If you don&#39;t get hired, we keep working with you. No time limit.

I can offer that because our placement rate is 94%.

So yes, you&#39;ve tried other things. But you haven&#39;t tried THIS.

Does that make sense?&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Proof Element:</h3>
<p>&quot;I had a student, [NAME], who had tried THREE other programs before us.</p>
<p>They spent over $10,000 and got zero results.</p>
<p>They were skeptical as hell when they joined us.</p>
<p>But they gave it a shot. And within 7 weeks, they landed a $88K remote role.</p>
<p>You know what they told me? &#39;I wish I had found you first. This is what I was looking for the whole time.&#39;</p>
<p>Those other programs failed you. But this one won&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<h3>Close:</h3>
<p>&quot;So here&#39;s the question: Are you going to let past failures stop you from future success?</p>
<p>Or are you going to give yourself one more chance with a program that actually works?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get started.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>OBJECTION #7: &quot;What if I don&#39;t get a job?&quot;</h2>
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Risk aversion (fear of wasting money)</li>
<li>Self-doubt (imposter syndrome)</li>
<li>Wants certainty</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reframe Script:</h3>
<pre><code>&quot;That&#39;s the best question you could ask. Because it shows you&#39;re thinking long-term.

Here&#39;s my answer:

If you don&#39;t get a job, we keep working with you until you do. No time limit. No expiration date.

I can offer that guarantee because our job placement rate is 94%.

When people follow the system, they get hired. Period.

The only way you DON&#39;T get a job is if you quit. And we don&#39;t let you quit.

So the risk isn&#39;t &#39;What if I don&#39;t get a job?&#39; The risk is &#39;What if I don&#39;t try and stay stuck for another year?&#39;

Which risk scares you more?&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Proof Element:</h3>
<p>&quot;Let me tell you about our guarantee:</p>
<p>We&#39;ve had students who struggled at first. Maybe they weren&#39;t doing the work consistently, or they were targeting the wrong roles.</p>
<p>But we didn&#39;t give up on them. We adjusted the strategy. We held them accountable. We stayed with them.</p>
<p>And every single one of them eventually got hired.</p>
<p>That&#39;s the power of having a SYSTEM and a TEAM behind you.</p>
<p>You&#39;re not doing this alone.&quot;</p>
<h3>Close:</h3>
<p>&quot;So the question isn&#39;t &#39;What if I don&#39;t get a job?&#39; It&#39;s &#39;When do I want to start?&#39;</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get you in the March cohort and get this done.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>OBJECTION #8: &quot;Can I start next month/quarter?&quot;</h2>
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Procrastination</li>
<li>Timing concern (real or perceived)</li>
<li>Avoiding commitment</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reframe Script:</h3>
<pre><code>&quot;I hear you. And let me ask: What&#39;s different about next month vs this month?&quot;

[They explain - usually vague]

&quot;Got it. Here&#39;s the challenge:

Every month you wait is another month you&#39;re underpaid and stuck.

If your new job pays $30K more per year, that&#39;s $2,500 per MONTH you&#39;re leaving on the table.

So by waiting one month, you&#39;re potentially losing $2,500.

Plus, the March cohort is filling up. If you wait, the next available cohort is May - that&#39;s TWO months from now.

That&#39;s $5,000 in lost income.

So really, you can&#39;t afford to wait.

What if we got you started in the March cohort, and you could start the actual work next month?

That way you lock in your spot and don&#39;t lose out.&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Proof Element:</h3>
<p>&quot;I had someone last year who wanted to wait until after the holidays.</p>
<p>I said okay, no problem.</p>
<p>They reached out in January and said they were ready.</p>
<p>But by then, the cohort was full, the bonuses were gone, and the price had gone up.</p>
<p>They ended up paying MORE and waiting LONGER.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t make that mistake.&quot;</p>
<h3>Close:</h3>
<p>&quot;Look, the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is right now.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get you enrolled today. You can start the work whenever you&#39;re ready, but at least you&#39;ll have locked in your spot and your bonuses.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>OBJECTION #9: &quot;Your competitor is cheaper&quot;</h2>
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Price shopping</li>
<li>Doesn&#39;t understand value difference</li>
<li>Wants validation for cheaper option</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reframe Script:</h3>
<pre><code>&quot;That&#39;s great! And let me ask: What&#39;s included in their program?&quot;

[They explain - usually vague or less comprehensive]

&quot;Got it. So here&#39;s the difference:

They might have a course or some videos. That&#39;s information.

We have a complete SYSTEM, weekly coaching, 1-on-1 sessions, insider access to 500+ recruiters, and a job guarantee.

They leave you alone after you buy. We work with you until you get hired.

So yes, they&#39;re cheaper. But what&#39;s the point of saving $2,000 if you don&#39;t get results?

Cheap programs keep you stuck. Premium programs change your life.

Which do you want?&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Proof Element:</h3>
<p>&quot;I had a student who bought a $497 course from a competitor.</p>
<p>They went through it, didn&#39;t get results, and ended up joining us 4 months later.</p>
<p>They told me, &#39;I wish I had just started with you. I wasted 4 months and $500.&#39;</p>
<p>Don&#39;t make the same mistake. Buy once, cry once.&quot;</p>
<h3>Close:</h3>
<p>&quot;Here&#39;s the question: Do you want the cheapest option, or the one that actually WORKS?</p>
<p>Because if you want results, we&#39;re the best investment.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get started.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<h2>OBJECTION #10: &quot;I can figure this out myself&quot;</h2>
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li>DIY mindset (frugal or independent)</li>
<li>Doesn&#39;t see value in coaching</li>
<li>Ego (doesn&#39;t want to admit needing help)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reframe Script:</h3>
<pre><code>&quot;I respect that. And you&#39;re probably right - you COULD figure it out yourself.

But here&#39;s the question:

How long will it take you?

Most people spend 6-12 months trying to figure it out alone. Meanwhile, our students land jobs in 45-60 days.

So you&#39;d save money, but lose 6-10 months of TIME.

And time is money. If your new job pays $30K more per year, that&#39;s $15K-$25K you&#39;d lose by taking 6-10 months instead of 2 months.

So really, trying to save $5,000 could cost you $20,000.

Does that make sense?&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Proof Element:</h3>
<p>&quot;I had someone tell me this last year.</p>
<p>They said, &#39;I&#39;m smart. I can figure it out.&#39;</p>
<p>Six months later, they reached out and said, &#39;Okay, I give up. This is harder than I thought. Can I still join?&#39;</p>
<p>I said yes. And they landed a job in 5 weeks.</p>
<p>They told me, &#39;I wasted 6 months of my life trying to do this alone. I should have just invested in the system from the start.&#39;</p>
<p>Don&#39;t make the same mistake.&quot;</p>
<h3>Close:</h3>
<p>&quot;Look, you can spend the next year figuring it out alone, or you can follow a proven system and be done in 60 days.</p>
<p>Which sounds better?</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get you started.&quot;</p>

<h2>OBJECTION #11: &quot;I&#39;m not ready to commit&quot;</h2>

<li>Fear of commitment</li>
<li>Uncertainty</li>
<li>Procrastination habit</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reframe Script:</h3>
<pre><code>&quot;I hear you. And let me ask: What does &#39;ready&#39; look like for you?&quot;

[They usually don&#39;t have a clear answer]

&quot;Here&#39;s the thing: You&#39;re never going to FEEL ready.

If you wait until you feel ready, you&#39;ll be waiting forever.

The people who succeed aren&#39;t the ones who feel ready. They&#39;re the ones who commit BEFORE they&#39;re ready and figure it out along the way.

So the question isn&#39;t &#39;Am I ready?&#39; It&#39;s &#39;Do I want this enough to make it happen?&#39;

Do you?&quot;
</code></pre>
<h3>Proof Element:</h3>
<p>&quot;Every successful student I&#39;ve worked with said the same thing when they started: &#39;I&#39;m nervous. I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m ready.&#39;</p>
<p>But they did it anyway.</p>
<p>And now they&#39;re making $70K-$120K in remote jobs and telling me, &#39;This was the best decision I ever made.&#39;</p>
<p>You&#39;ll never feel ready. But you&#39;ll be GLAD you started.&quot;</p>
<h3>Close:</h3>
<p>&quot;So let&#39;s stop overthinking and get you started.</p>

<h2>OBJECTION #12: &quot;What if I change my mind?&quot;</h2>
<h3>Root Cause:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fear of regret</li>
<li>Wants easy out</li>
<li>Risk aversion</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reframe Script:</h3>
<pre><code>&quot;Great question. And here&#39;s my answer:

You won&#39;t change your mind.

Not because there&#39;s no refund policy (there isn&#39;t - this is a done-WITH-you program, not a digital download).

But because once you start seeing results, you&#39;ll be ALL IN.

Here&#39;s what happens:

Week 1: You&#39;ll rebuild your resume and LinkedIn using our frameworks
Week 2: You&#39;ll start getting responses from companies
Week 3: You&#39;ll have your first interviews
Week 4: You&#39;ll realize this actually works

By week 2, you won&#39;t WANT a refund. You&#39;ll want more.

But let me ask YOU: Why do you think you&#39;d change your mind?

What&#39;s the fear underneath that question?&quot;

[They reveal the real objection - handle that]
</code></pre>
<h3>Proof Element:</h3>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve never had a student ask for a refund after starting.</p>
<p>You know why? Because the system works.</p>
<p>Once they see the first result - the first interview, the first recruiter reaching out, the first offer - they&#39;re hooked.</p>
<p>The only people who regret it are the ones who DON&#39;T do the work.</p>
<p>But if you&#39;re committed to doing the work, you won&#39;t change your mind.&quot;</p>
<h3>Close:</h3>
<p>&quot;So let&#39;s get real: Are you committed to doing this? Or are you looking for an easy out?</p>
<p>Because if you&#39;re looking for an easy out, this isn&#39;t for you.</p>
<p>But if you&#39;re committed to changing your life, let&#39;s get started.</p>

<h1>5. CLOSING TECHNIQUES LIBRARY</h1>
<h2>5.1 TRIAL CLOSES (Test Buying Temperature)</h2>
<p><strong>Trial Close #1: The Scale</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Based on what we&#39;ve discussed, on a scale of 1-10, how excited are you about this?&quot;

[If 8-10: &quot;Great! Let&#39;s get you started.&quot;]
[If 5-7: &quot;What would make it a 10?&quot;]
[If 1-4: &quot;Sounds like this isn&#39;t for you. What&#39;s your concern?&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Trial Close #2: Belief Check</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Do you believe this system works?&quot;
[Yes]

&quot;And do you believe it could work for you?&quot;
[Yes]

&quot;Great! So let&#39;s get you enrolled.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Trial Close #3: Future Pacing</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Can you see yourself landing your dream remote job in 60 days?&quot;

[If yes: &quot;Perfect! Let&#39;s make that happen.&quot;]
[If no: &quot;What&#39;s stopping you from seeing that?&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Trial Close #4: Fit Check</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Does this sound like what you&#39;ve been looking for?&quot;

[If yes: Move to close]
[If hesitant: &quot;What&#39;s missing?&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Trial Close #5: Problem-Solution Agreement</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;So we agree that [THEIR PROBLEM] is the issue, and our system solves that, right?&quot;

[Yes]

&quot;Perfect. Let&#39;s get started then.&quot;
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>5.2 ASSUMPTIVE CLOSES (Assume They&#39;re Buying)</h2>
<p><strong>Assumptive #1: Next Steps Frame</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Alright, here&#39;s what happens next:

As soon as we get off this call, I&#39;ll send you your onboarding email.

You&#39;ll get access to the portal immediately, and your first coaching call is [DATE].

The investment is [PRICE]. Would you prefer one payment or three?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Assumptive #2: Logistics Focus</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;So when we get started, your first step is to complete Module 1 - that&#39;s the resume and LinkedIn rebuild.

Then we jump on our first 1-on-1 to review it.

Sound good? Let&#39;s get you enrolled.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Assumptive #3: Scheduling Close</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;I&#39;ll send you the onboarding info after this call.

Your first coaching session is [DAY] at [TIME]. Does that work for your schedule, or do you need a different time?&quot;

[They answer logistics - now they&#39;re mentally enrolled]

&quot;Great. Let&#39;s process your payment and get you locked in.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Assumptive #4: Start Date Focus</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;So you&#39;ll be starting in the March cohort. That kicks off on March 10th.

Between now and then, you&#39;ll have access to the portal so you can get a head start.

One payment or installments?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Assumptive #5: Team Intro</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Once you&#39;re enrolled, I&#39;ll introduce you to the team.

You&#39;ll meet [NAME], who handles the recruiter intros, and [NAME], who does the interview prep.

Let&#39;s get you set up. Payment in full or payment plan?&quot;
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>5.3 URGENCY CLOSES (Time-Sensitive)</h2>
<p><strong>Urgency #1: Spot Scarcity</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Just so you know, we only have 2 spots left for the March cohort.

If those fill up today, the next available cohort is May - that&#39;s 8 weeks from now.

Do you want to wait 8 weeks, or do you want to start in 3 days?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Urgency #2: Bonus Expiration</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;The fast-action bonuses expire tonight at midnight.

That&#39;s $991 in value you&#39;ll lose if you wait.

Let&#39;s get you enrolled so you lock those in.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Urgency #3: Price Increase</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Right now you&#39;re getting the Founders Rate - $4,997.

Next week, that goes up to $7,997.

If you enroll today, you save $3,000.

That&#39;s a no-brainer, right?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Urgency #4: Opportunity Cost</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Every week you wait is another week you&#39;re underpaid.

If your new job pays $30K more per year, that&#39;s $577 per week.

So by waiting even one week, you&#39;re losing $577.

Let&#39;s get you started today so you stop leaving money on the table.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Urgency #5: Cohort Start Date</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;The March cohort starts in 3 days.

If you enroll today, you&#39;re in.

If you wait, you miss it and have to wait until May.

That&#39;s 2 extra months of being stuck.

What makes more sense - starting now or waiting 2 months?&quot;
</code></pre>

<h2>5.4 TAKEAWAY CLOSES (Reverse Psychology)</h2>
<p><strong>Takeaway #1: Qualification Challenge</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;[NAME], let me be honest with you...

I don&#39;t think you&#39;re ready for this.

This program is for people who are DONE playing small and ready to go all-in.

It sounds like you&#39;re still in exploration mode, and that&#39;s fine. But this isn&#39;t for explorers.

If you&#39;re not willing to commit, this isn&#39;t the right fit.&quot;

[60% of the time, they&#39;ll fight to stay in]

&quot;Wait, no - I AM ready...&quot;

[Handle their objection and close]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Takeaway #2: The Walk Away</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;You know what? I don&#39;t think this is for you.

You&#39;ve got a lot of objections, and it seems like you&#39;re not convinced.

And that&#39;s okay. This isn&#39;t for everyone.

I think you should pass on this and figure it out on your own.&quot;

[Silence - let them sit with it]

&quot;Actually, I do want this. I just...&quot;

[Handle their objection and close]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Takeaway #3: The Fit Check</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Let me ask you something:

Are you actually serious about changing your career, or are you just window shopping?

Because if you&#39;re serious, let&#39;s do this.

But if you&#39;re just gathering information, let&#39;s not waste each other&#39;s time.&quot;

[Forces them to declare commitment]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Takeaway #4: The Premium Positioning</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;This program isn&#39;t for everyone.

We only work with people who are coachable, committed, and ready to do the work.

If that&#39;s not you, this won&#39;t work.

So let me ask: Are you that person?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Takeaway #5: The Future Regret</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Look, I&#39;ve been doing this long enough to know who&#39;s going to succeed and who&#39;s going to stay stuck.

The people who succeed are the ones who say yes when opportunity knocks.

The people who stay stuck are the ones who say &#39;Let me think about it.&#39;

Which one are you?&quot;

<h2>5.5 ALTERNATIVE CLOSES (Give Them Choices)</h2>
<p><strong>Alternative #1: Payment Options</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;We have two options:

Option 1: Pay in full today - $4,997
Option 2: Three payments - $1,797 each

Most people do the payment plan because it&#39;s easier on cash flow.

Which do you prefer?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Alternative #2: Start Date</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Would you prefer to start in the March cohort or the May cohort?&quot;

[Either answer = they&#39;re buying]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Alternative #3: Session Timing</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Do you prefer morning coaching calls or afternoon?&quot;

[Logistics focus = mental commitment]
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Alternative #4: Tier Selection</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;We have two tiers:

VIP: Includes 1-on-1 coaching and recruiter intros - $4,997
Standard: Group coaching only - $2,997

Which makes more sense for you?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Alternative #5: Commitment Level</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Some people want to go all-in and land a job in 30-45 days.

Others prefer to take it slow and go at their own pace.

Which describes you?&quot;

[Either answer = closes them into one of your tiers]
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h2>5.6 EMOTIONAL CLOSES (Pull Heartstrings)</h2>
<p><strong>Emotional #1: Family</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Imagine 60 days from now...

You walk into your house after landing your dream job.

You tell your [spouse/kids/parents], &#39;I did it. I got the job.&#39;

How would that feel?&quot;

[Let them sit in it]

&quot;Let&#39;s make that happen. Let&#39;s get you started.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Emotional #2: Self-Worth</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Here&#39;s what I know about you:

You&#39;re capable. You&#39;re talented. You deserve better than what you have right now.

The only thing standing between you and the life you want is a SYSTEM.

So stop undervaluing yourself and invest in your future.

You&#39;re worth it. Let&#39;s do this.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Emotional #3: Regret Avoidance</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Six months from now, you&#39;re either going to wish you had started today...

Or you&#39;re going to be GLAD you did.

Which do you want?&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Emotional #4: Breaking the Pattern</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;How long have you been stuck in this cycle?

Applying to jobs, getting ghosted, feeling frustrated?

Aren&#39;t you tired of it?

This is your chance to break the pattern and do something different.

Let&#39;s make it happen.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Emotional #5: The Why</strong></p>
<pre><code>&quot;Let me take you back to the beginning.

You told me your biggest frustration was [THEIR PAIN].

You said if you could change that, [THEIR VISION].

That&#39;s what this is about. That&#39;s what we&#39;re fighting for.

So let&#39;s stop overthinking and get you there.

Are you ready?&quot;

<h2>7.3 SPLIT TESTING</h2>
<h3>What to Test First (Highest Impact)</h3>
<p><strong>Priority 1: Webinar Offer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What you&#39;re selling (VIP vs Standard vs DIY)</li>
<li>Price point ($4,997 vs $3,997 vs $2,997)</li>
<li>Payment options (one-pay vs installments)</li>
<li>Bonuses (which ones, how many)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> 30-50% lift in conversions</p>
<p><strong>Priority 2: Webinar Close Sequence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you transition from teaching to selling (minute 30 vs 40)</li>
<li>How many CTAs you give (5 vs 7 vs 10)</li>
<li>Urgency messaging (spot scarcity vs bonus expiration)</li>
<li>Application vs direct purchase</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> 20-30% lift</p>
<p><strong>Priority 3: Post-Webinar Email Sequence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Subject lines</li>
<li>Send timing (immediate vs 2h later)</li>
<li>Number of emails (4 vs 6 vs 8)</li>
<li>Tone (urgent vs educational)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> 10-20% lift</p>

<ul>
<li>Discovery depth (15 min vs 25 min)</li>
<li>Proof placement (when you show testimonials)</li>
<li>Closing technique (assumptive vs alternative)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> 5-15% lift</p>
<p><strong>Priority 5: Pre-Webinar Sequence</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reminder emails (2 vs 4 vs 6)</li>
<li>Commitment devices (homework vs survey)</li>
<li>Pre-webinar video (yes vs no)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Impact:</strong> 5-10% lift in show rate</p>
<h3>Sample Sizes Needed</h3>
<p><strong>For Statistically Significant Results:</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Test</th>
<th>Minimum Sample</th>
<th>Ideal Sample</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td>Webinar offer/price</td>
<td>100 attendees per variant</td>
<td>200+ per variant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Email subject line</td>
<td>500 recipients per variant</td>
<td>1,000+ per variant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sales call script</td>
<td>20 calls per variant</td>
<td>50+ per variant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Landing page</td>
<td>1,000 visitors per variant</td>
<td>5,000+ per variant</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p><strong>Rule of Thumb:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Need at least 30-50 conversions per variant for reliability</li>
<li>Run test for at least 2 weeks (accounts for day-of-week variance)</li>
<li>Don&#39;t stop test early even if one variant is winning</li>
</ul>
<h3>Testing Cadence</h3>
<p><strong>Weekly:</strong> Minor tweaks (email subject lines, CTA copy)<br><strong>Bi-Weekly:</strong> Medium changes (email sequence structure)<br><strong>Monthly:</strong> Major changes (webinar structure, offer changes)<br><strong>Quarterly:</strong> Complete overhauls (new webinar, new sales process)</p>
<p><strong>What NOT to Test:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Don&#39;t test multiple things at once (can&#39;t isolate what worked)</li>
<li>Don&#39;t test with small sample sizes (unreliable data)</li>
<li>Don&#39;t change tests mid-stream (invalidates results)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Testing Framework</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1: Hypothesis</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;We believe that [CHANGE] will result in [OUTCOME] because [REASON]&quot;</li>
<li>Example: &quot;We believe that adding a 6-month payment plan will increase close rate by 15% because it lowers the barrier to entry&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 2: Design Test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Control (current method)</li>
<li>Variant (new method)</li>
<li>Traffic split (50/50)</li>
<li>Success metric (close rate)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 3: Run Test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Duration: 2-4 weeks</li>
<li>Monitor daily but don&#39;t make decisions until complete</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 4: Analyze Results</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Which variant won?</li>
<li>By how much? (% lift)</li>
<li>Is it statistically significant?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5: Implement Winner</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Roll out winning variant to 100%</li>
<li>Document learnings</li>
<li>Move to next test</li>

<h3>CRM Setup (GoHighLevel / HubSpot / Salesforce)</h3>
<p><strong>Required Fields:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Phone</li>

<li>Source (webinar date, ad campaign)</li>
<li>Lead stage</li>
<li>Assigned closer</li>
<li>Tags (objections, interests, urgency level)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Automation Triggers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Webinar attendance → Add to post-webinar sequence</li>
<li>Application submitted → Notify closer + send booking link</li>
<li>Call scheduled → Send pre-call video + calendar reminders</li>
<li>Call completed → Tag outcome + trigger follow-up sequence</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lead Response Time</h3>
<p><strong>Best Practice:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Respond to application within 2 hours (ideally 30 minutes)</li>
<li>If someone applies during webinar, call them within 1 hour</li>
<li>Faster response = higher close rate</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Data:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;1 hour response: 60% close rate</li>
<li>1-3 hour response: 50% close rate</li>
<li>3-24 hour response: 40% close rate</li>
<li><blockquote>
<p>24 hour response: 20% close rate</p>

<h3>Closing Technique Decision Tree</h3>
<p><strong>If Prospect Says YES Immediately:</strong><br>→ Use Assumptive Close</p>
<p><strong>If Prospect is Hesitant:</strong><br>→ Use Trial Close to identify concern<br>→ Handle objection<br>→ Use Alternative Close</p>
<p><strong>If Prospect is Skeptical:</strong><br>→ Use Proof stacking<br>→ Use Emotional Close</p>
<p><strong>If Prospect is Analytical:</strong><br>→ Use ROI breakdown<br>→ Use Alternative Close (payment options)</p>
<p><strong>If Prospect is Stalling:</strong><br>→ Use Urgency Close<br>→ Then Takeaway Close if needed</p>
