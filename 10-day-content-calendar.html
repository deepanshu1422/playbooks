My friend Raj just moved from Bangalore (₹18L) to Amsterdam (€65K).

His take-home DOUBLED.

Here's the math everyone gets wrong:

🇮🇳 BANGALORE (₹18L/year):
- Gross: ₹18,00,000
- Tax: ₹3,60,000 (20%)
- Take-home: ₹14,40,000/year = ₹1,20,000/month

Monthly expenses:
- Rent (2BHK): ₹40,000
- Food: ₹15,000
- Transport: ₹10,000
- Utilities: ₹5,000
- Entertainment: ₹10,000
Total: ₹80,000/month

Net savings: ₹40,000/month = ₹4.8L/year

---

🇳🇱 AMSTERDAM (€65,000/year):
- Gross: €65,000
- Tax: €18,000 (28%)
- Take-home: €47,000/year = €3,917/month

Monthly expenses:
- Rent (1-bed): €1,400
- Food: €300
- Transport: €100 (bike culture!)
- Utilities: €150
- Entertainment: €200
Total: €2,150/month

Net savings: €1,767/month = €21,204/year = ₹19.5L/year

---

RESULT:
- Bangalore savings: ₹4.8L/year
- Amsterdam savings: ₹19.5L/year
- Difference: 4x more savings

Plus:
✅ Better work-life balance
✅ 30 days vacation (vs 15 in India)
✅ Free healthcare
✅ Travel all of Europe on weekends

The numbers don't lie.

<br>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> Text post (listicle)</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Copy:</strong></p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code>
I spent the last month DMing Indians who moved to Amsterdam for tech jobs.

Asked them: "What do you wish you knew before relocating?"

Here are the top 5 insights:

1️⃣ "I should've negotiated salary better"
Most accepted first offer. Big mistake.
Dutch companies EXPECT negotiation.
Lesson: Always ask for €5K-10K more. They'll respect you for it.

2️⃣ "I underestimated the tax benefits"
30% ruling = 30% of your salary is tax-free (for expats).
Example: €70K job with 30% ruling = effective €91K.
Lesson: Ask your employer to apply for this. It's FREE money.

3️⃣ "Finding housing is HELL"
Amsterdam housing crisis is real. Expect 3-6 months of searching.
Lesson: Start looking BEFORE you move. Join Facebook groups.

4️⃣ "Learning Dutch helps (but not required)"
Work is 100% English. But daily life (doctor, bank) = easier with Dutch.
Lesson: Take free classes (gemeente offers them). Opens doors.

5️⃣ "Indian community is HUGE"
300K+ Indians in Netherlands. WhatsApp groups for everything.
Lesson: You won't feel alone. Community support is strong.

<h2>DAY 4: Thursday - Specific Pain Point</h2>
<br>
<h3>Post 1 (9:00 AM IST) - Spain Deep Dive</h3>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> "Spain's new 5-year visa is a GAME-CHANGER. Here's how to qualify (even if you work for an Indian company remotely):"</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> Carousel (8-10 slides)</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Content:</strong></p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code>
Slide 1: Cover
"Spain 5-Year Visa: Work Remotely from Barcelona
(While keeping your Indian salary)"

Slide 2: What is it?
Spain Digital Nomad Visa (2023 law)
- 5-year residence permit
- Work remotely for ANY company (Indian, US, doesn't matter)
- Bring family
- Path to permanent residency

Slide 3: Who Qualifies?
- Remote worker OR freelancer
- Income: €2,400/month minimum (~₹2.2L/month)
- Health insurance
- Clean criminal record
- That's IT. No job offer needed.

Slide 4: How It Works
1. Get remote job/clients
2. Apply for visa (3-6 months processing)
3. Move to Spain
4. Renew after 1 year, then every 2 years
5. Apply for permanent residency after 5 years

Slide 5: Why Spain?
- Barcelona = European tech hub
- Lower cost of living than Netherlands/Germany
- Amazing weather, food, lifestyle
- English widely spoken in tech scene

Slide 6: Real Example
Priya: Senior React dev at Indian startup (₹30L/year)
- Moved to Barcelona on digital nomad visa
- Still works remotely for Indian company
- Lives in 2-bed apartment (€1,200/month)
- Travels Europe on weekends
- Same salary, 10x better life

Slide 7: Living Cost Breakdown
Barcelona:
- Rent (1-bed): €900-1,200
- Food: €300-400
- Transport: €50-80
- Entertainment: €200
Total: €1,500-1,900/month

On ₹2.5L/month? You're living GOOD.

Slide 8: How to Apply
1. Gather documents (3 months bank statements, employment contract, insurance)
2. Apply at Spanish consulate in India
3. Wait 3-6 months
4. Get visa, book flight
5. Register in Spain within 30 days

Slide 9: The Catch
- Tax: Spain will tax your income (progressive, 19-45%)
- But: Special tax regime for new residents (0-10% for first 6 years)
- Net: Still way more savings than India

Slide 10: CTA
"This is the easiest way to move to Europe RIGHT NOW.

No job offer needed. No language requirement. 5-year visa.

DM me SPAIN to get the full application checklist.

Everyone wants to move abroad for a tech job.

But 95% never do it.

Here are the 5 excuses I hear (and the truth):

---

❌ OBJECTION 1: "I don't have international work experience"

✅ TRUTH: European companies don't care.
They care about: Can you code? Can you solve problems?
Your Bangalore startup experience = just as valid as London experience.
Proof: 4,500 Indians I know landed jobs with 0 international experience.

---

❌ OBJECTION 2: "Visa is too complicated"

✅ TRUTH: Netherlands HSM visa = 2-3 weeks processing.
You don't do anything. Company does it for you.
You just provide documents. That's it.
People spend more time arguing on Twitter than getting a visa.

---

❌ OBJECTION 3: "I'll be homesick / miss family"

✅ TRUTH: Video calls exist. Flights exist.
Amsterdam to Delhi = 8 hours.
You'll visit home 2-3 times/year (with 30 days vacation).
Meanwhile, your family is PROUD you made it.

---

❌ OBJECTION 4: "Salary abroad = higher taxes"

✅ TRUTH: Even with higher tax, your NET savings are 3-4x.
UAE: 0% tax (you keep everything).
Netherlands: 30% ruling (30% of salary tax-free for expats).
Math doesn't lie. Your bank account will thank you.

---

❌ OBJECTION 5: "What about my partner/family?"

✅ TRUTH: Most visas allow family immediately.
Netherlands: Spouse gets work permit automatically.
Kids: Free education (yes, FREE).
You're not abandoning anyone. You're upgrading everyone's life.

<div class="code-block"><pre><code>
You're in Bangalore. You want a €70K job in Amsterdam.

Here's the exact 90-day plan:

---

WEEK 1-2: FOUNDATION

1. Update your resume (European format):
   - No photo (unless asked)
   - Focus on impact, not duties
   - Quantify everything ("Reduced API latency by 40%")
   - PDF only
   - 1-2 pages max

2. Optimize LinkedIn:
   - Add "Open to international opportunities" in headline
   - Update location to "Amsterdam, Netherlands" (yes, even before moving)
   - Add "Visa: Open to HSM sponsorship"
   - Write posts about your tech work (build authority)

3. Research companies:
   - Make list of 50 companies hiring in your tech stack
   - Check if they sponsor visas (LinkedIn → filter by Indians working there)
   - Priority: Booking.com, Adyen, Elastic, TomTom, ING, ABN AMRO

---

WEEK 3-4: APPLICATION BLITZ

4. Apply to 30 companies:
   - Direct on company careers page (not LinkedIn Easy Apply)
   - Customize cover letter for each (mention why Netherlands, why that company)
   - Send on Tuesday-Thursday mornings (European time)

5. Direct outreach:
   - Find hiring managers on LinkedIn
   - Send personalized message: "Hi [Name], I'm [Your Name], backend engineer from India. I saw you're hiring for [Role]. I'd love to discuss how my experience with [Tech] can help your team. Open to HSM visa. Can we chat?"
   - Send 20 messages/week

---

WEEK 5-8: INTERVIEWS

6. Interview prep:
   - European style = less algorithmic, more system design + real-world problem solving
   - Practice explaining your projects clearly
   - Prepare questions about visa process (shows seriousness)

7. Multiple applications rule:
   - Keep applying while interviewing
   - Goal: 5-10 interviews in pipeline
   - Some will ghost. Some will move fast. You need options.

---

WEEK 9-12: OFFERS + VISA

8. Negotiate:
   - Ask for €5K-10K more than first offer
   - Ask about 30% ruling (tax benefit for expats)
   - Ask about relocation bonus (€2K-5K common)

9. Visa process:
   - Company applies for HSM (you provide docs)
   - Processing: 2-3 weeks
   - You get visa → book flight
   - Land in Netherlands → register with municipality → get BSN number → open bank account

10. Move:
    - Find temporary housing (Airbnb for first month)
    - Join "Indians in Amsterdam" Facebook groups
    - Start working!

---

TOTAL TIMELINE: 90 days from start to offer. 120 days to landing.

This isn't theory. This is what WORKS.

<h2>DAY 7: Sunday - Social Proof Day</h2>
<br>
<h3>Post 1 (11:00 AM IST) - Case Study</h3>
<p><strong>Headline:</strong> "Case Study: How Raj went from ₹22L in Pune to €68K in Amsterdam (€4K net savings/month)"</p>
<br>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> Long-form storytelling</p>

<p><strong>Copy:</strong></p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code>
Meet Raj.

3 years ago: Backend engineer in Pune, ₹22L/year, stuck in traffic 3 hours/day.

Today: Senior backend engineer in Amsterdam, €68K/year, bikes to work in 15 minutes.

Here's EXACTLY how he did it:

---

STARTING POINT (2023):
- Age: 28
- Experience: 5 years (Java, Spring Boot, Microservices)
- Salary: ₹22L/year
- Company: Mid-sized Indian startup
- Situation: Good job, but felt stuck. Wanted more.

---

THE DECISION:
Raj told me: "I saw my college friends moving abroad. I thought visa was impossible. Then I researched Netherlands HSM visa. 2-3 weeks? I had to try."

---

THE PROCESS:

Month 1:
- Updated resume (European format)
- Applied to 40 companies
- Got 5 responses

Month 2:
- 3 interviews
- 1 offer: €62K from a scale-up in Amsterdam
- He negotiated → €68K

Month 3:
- Company applied for HSM visa
- Approved in 18 days (faster than expected)
- Gave notice at Indian company

Month 4:
- Landed in Amsterdam
- Stayed in Airbnb for 2 weeks
- Found 1-bed apartment (€1,450/month)
- Started job

---

THE MATH (1 year later):

BEFORE (India):
- Salary: ₹22L/year = ₹1.83L/month
- Tax: ₹4.5L/year
- Take-home: ₹17.5L/year = ₹1.46L/month
- Expenses: ₹1L/month (Pune)
- Savings: ₹46K/month = ₹5.5L/year

AFTER (Netherlands):
- Salary: €68K/year = €5,667/month
- Tax (with 30% ruling): €1,400/month
- Take-home: €4,267/month
- Expenses: €2,200/month (Amsterdam)
- Savings: €2,067/month = €24,804/year = ₹23L/year

RESULT: 4.2x more savings 🤯

---

INTANGIBLES:

✅ 30 days vacation (vs 15 in India)
✅ No traffic (bikes everywhere)
✅ Free healthcare
✅ Traveled to 12 European countries in 1 year
✅ Quality of life: "I actually have a LIFE outside work now"

---

Raj's advice to you:

"Stop overthinking. The visa process is simpler than you think. The job market is hungry for Indian talent. You just need to START."

The tech relocation industry is broken.

Let me explain.

---

WHAT MOST SERVICES DO:

❌ Sell you a course ("Watch 50 hours of videos!")
❌ Give you generic advice ("Update your LinkedIn!")
❌ Charge ₹50K-2L for basically nothing
❌ No accountability ("We taught you, what you do with it is your problem")
❌ Focus on H1B / Canada (2-3 year process, lottery system)

RESULT: You're stuck in "learning mode" forever. No job. No visa. Wasted money.

---

WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS:

✅ Target countries with FAST visas (Netherlands: 2-3 weeks, not 2-3 years)
✅ Direct 1-on-1 support (not generic videos)
✅ Real company intros (not "here's a list, good luck")
✅ Accountability (we don't stop until you land the job)
✅ Guarantee (land offer in 6 months or work with us until you do)

---

WHY I'M DIFFERENT:

1. I've placed 4,500+ people in tech roles (I know what works)
2. I worked at MakeMyTrip → Alibaba (I've lived the international career path)
3. I have a network of hiring managers (Google, Takeda, 100+ companies)
4. I only focus on working professionals (not students, not H1B lottery)
5. I focus on countries where INDIANS ACTUALLY GET HIRED FAST (not pipe dreams)

---

THE PROMISE:

If you're a working professional with 3+ years experience:
- I'll help you land a €70K+ European / $100K+ US remote job
- In 90-180 days
- With full visa support
- Or I keep working with you until you do

No fluff. No courses. No "watch and pray."

Real introductions. Real interviews. Real offers.

This is how career transitions SHOULD work.

<p><strong>Copy:</strong></p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code>
I've gotten 500+ DMs in the last week.

Here are the top 10 questions (with straight answers):

---

Q1: "Can I really get a visa in 2-3 weeks?"
A: YES. Netherlands HSM visa = 2-3 weeks IF company applies. Company does everything. You just provide documents.

Q2: "Do I need to speak Dutch / Spanish / German?"
A: NO. Tech jobs = English. Learn local language for daily life (helps, but not required for work).

Q3: "What if I don't have a CS degree?"
A: 5+ years experience = degree equivalent. Most countries accept this. Portugal, Spain especially flexible.

Q4: "Will companies actually sponsor me?"
A: YES. Tech talent shortage is REAL in Europe. They're desperate. You're solving their problem.

Q5: "How much does relocation cost?"
A: Flight: ₹50K. First month housing: ₹1L. Total: ₹2-3L. Most companies give relocation bonus (₹1-2L). Net: ₹1L out of pocket.

Q6: "What if I fail interviews?"
A: You will. Average: 10 applications → 3 interviews → 1 offer. Keep applying. It's a numbers game.

Q7: "Can I bring my family?"
A: YES. Most visas allow spouse + kids immediately. Spouse usually gets work permit too.

Q8: "What about taxes?"
A: Higher tax rate, but NET savings are 3-4x more. Math: India ₹25L = ₹5L savings. Netherlands €65K = ₹20L savings.

Q9: "Do I need to quit my job to apply?"
A: NO. Apply while working. Give notice only after visa approval. Zero risk.

Q10: "Is this just for senior engineers?"
A: NO. 3-5 years experience = mid-level = eligible. Don't need to be staff engineer.

[If video: Film yourself talking]
[If text: Below]

I've been thinking about this for months.

Should I launch publicly? Or keep it small?

Here's why I decided to go big:

---

6 months ago, I helped a friend (anonymously) land a job in Amsterdam.

He was earning ₹22L in Bangalore. Talented guy, but stuck.

I introduced him to a hiring manager I knew. He got the job (€68K). Moved in 3 months.

He called me crying (yes, CRYING) after his first month there.

"Deepanshu, I can't believe I waited this long. My quality of life is 10x better. I have SAVINGS now. I have TIME. Thank you."

That hit me.

---

I realized: I've been helping people get tech jobs for years.

But I focused on India placements.

What about people who want to move abroad?

They're stuck because:
- They don't know which countries are actually hiring
- They don't have connections to hiring managers
- They don't understand visa processes
- They waste months on H1B / Canada lottery systems

Meanwhile, there's a HUGE opportunity in Netherlands, Spain, UAE.

Fast visas. High salaries. Desperate for Indian talent.

But nobody's teaching this properly.

---

So I decided: I'm going to fix this.

I have:
- 4,500 placements of experience
- Network of hiring managers across Europe
- Lived the MakeMyTrip → Alibaba international career journey myself
- Credibility to open doors

I'm going to help 100 people relocate abroad this year.

Starting with 20 in March.

---

Why YOU should join?

Because the opportunity window is NOW.

Europe's tech shortage is at its peak.
Visa policies are favorable.
Remote work normalized post-COVID.

In 2-3 years? Who knows. Policies change. Markets shift.

But TODAY? The doors are wide open.

---

I'm not going to pitch you.

If this resonates, you'll DM me.

If it doesn't, that's cool too.

But don't let fear hold you back.

Don't let "someday" become never.

This is your moment.
