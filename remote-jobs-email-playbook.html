<h3>1.1 Lead Magnet: &quot;The Remote Job Search Roadmap&quot; (PDF Guide)</h3>
<p><strong>Trigger:</strong> Download of free roadmap<br><strong>Sequence Duration:</strong> 7 days</p>
<h4>Email 1 - Day 0 (Immediate delivery)</h4>
<p><strong>Subject Lines:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Here&#39;s your Remote Job Search Roadmap, {{FirstName}} 🎯</li>
<li>Your roadmap is ready (+ a personal note from me)</li>
<li>{{FirstName}}, this is how you land a remote role in 90 days</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>Hey {{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Thanks for downloading the Remote Job Search Roadmap!</p>
<p><strong>[DOWNLOAD BUTTON: Get Your Roadmap]</strong></p>
<p>Quick backstory: I created this roadmap after watching hundreds of talented professionals struggle with the same mistakes — applying to dozens of remote jobs and hearing nothing back.</p>
<p>The truth? Remote hiring works differently. Companies aren&#39;t just looking for skills; they&#39;re looking for people who <em>understand</em> remote work.</p>
<p>Inside your roadmap, you&#39;ll find:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 3-phase system I use with clients (worth $5K+ alone)</li>
<li>17 companies actively hiring remote roles right now</li>
<li>The &quot;async communication&quot; test that gets you noticed</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what to do next:</strong></p>
<p>Read through the roadmap this weekend. Mark the sections that resonate most with your situation.</p>
<p>Then, Monday morning, I&#39;m sending you a breakdown of the #1 mistake I see in remote job applications — and exactly how to fix it in under 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Sound good?</p>
<p>Talk soon,<br>[Your Name]</p>
<p>P.S. — Hit reply if you have questions. I read every email and respond personally.</p>

<h4>Email 2 - Day 2</h4>
<p><strong>Subject Lines:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The #1 mistake costing you remote interviews</li>
<li>{{FirstName}}, are you making this resume mistake?</li>
<li>Why your resume isn&#39;t getting remote callbacks (fix in 30 min)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>By now you&#39;ve had a chance to review the roadmap. Here&#39;s the insight I promised:</p>
<p><strong>The mistake:</strong> Your resume looks like every other office worker trying to go remote.</p>
<p>I reviewed 200+ resumes last quarter. Want to know what stood out?</p>
<p>Not more bullet points. Not fancier formatting.</p>
<p><strong>It was context.</strong></p>
<p>The candidates who got interviews didn&#39;t just list what they did — they showed they <em>already think like remote workers.</em></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>❌ &quot;Managed team of 5 across 3 projects&quot;<br>✅ &quot;Led distributed team across 3 time zones using Slack, Notion, and async standups — maintained 94% on-time delivery&quot;</p>
<p>See the difference?</p>
<p>One says &quot;I managed people.&quot; The other says &quot;I already know how remote teams operate.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Quick exercise (takes 20 min):</strong></p>
<p>Open your resume. For your last 2-3 roles, ask yourself:</p>
<ol>
<li>Did I work with anyone remotely? (Even occasionally?)</li>
<li>Did I use any collaboration tools? (Zoom, Slack, Asana, etc.)</li>
<li>Did I work independently or manage my own schedule?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you answered yes to ANY of these — that&#39;s remote-relevant experience. Put it in your resume.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll send you more specific examples on Thursday, including the exact phrases that get hiring managers to respond.</p>
<p>Keep going,<br>[Your Name]</p>
<p>P.S. — Already updated your resume? Reply and show me. I&#39;ll give you quick feedback.</p>

<li>The 7 words that get remote hiring managers to reply</li>

<li>{{FirstName}}, here&#39;s what to say (and what to avoid)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Today&#39;s email is tactical. You&#39;re getting the exact language that makes remote hiring managers lean forward.</p>
<p><strong>Frame #1: &quot;I&#39;ve been operating remotely before it was required&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Use when: You have any experience with distributed teams, even pre-2020.</p>
<p>Example: <em>&quot;While the pandemic forced many teams to adapt, I&#39;d already spent 2 years collaborating across time zones at {{Company}}, which taught me the discipline remote work requires.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Frame #2: &quot;I treat communication as a core skill, not an afterthought&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Use when: Applying to async-heavy companies (startups, tech, global teams).</p>
<p>Example: <em>&quot;I believe great remote work is 80% communication, 20% execution — which is why I document decisions, over-communicate blockers, and default to transparency.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Frame #3: &quot;I have a bias toward ownership&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Use when: You want to show initiative and self-direction.</p>
<p>Example: <em>&quot;In remote environments, I don&#39;t wait to be managed. If I see a gap, I fill it. If I need clarity, I ask. I take ownership of outcomes, not just tasks.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s how to use these:</strong></p>
<p>Drop them into your cover letter, LinkedIn summary, or interview answers. Don&#39;t force all 3 — pick the one that fits <em>your</em> story.</p>
<p>On Monday, I&#39;m sharing the exact interview question that trips up 90% of remote candidates (and the 2-minute answer that gets you hired).</p>
<p>Stay tuned,<br>[Your Name]</p>

<li>&quot;Tell me about a time you worked remotely...&quot;</li>
<li>The interview question that kills most candidates</li>
<li>{{FirstName}}, here&#39;s how to answer the remote work question</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Final email in this series. Let&#39;s talk interviews.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re applying to remote roles, you WILL get this question (or some version of it):</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Tell me about your experience working remotely.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Here&#39;s where most people fail:</p>
<p>They talk about the pandemic. How they &quot;adapted.&quot; How they used Zoom.</p>
<p>Boring. Every candidate says that.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what gets you hired:</strong></p>
<p>Tell a story about a challenge you solved <em>because</em> you were remote.</p>
<p>Example answer:</p>
<p><em>&quot;At {{Company}}, I was the only designer working with a dev team in a different time zone. Instead of waiting for synchronous meetings, I started recording 3-minute Loom videos explaining my design decisions. It cut feedback loops from 2 days to 2 hours — and the team actually preferred it because they could review on their own schedule.&quot;</em></p>
<p>See what happened there?</p>
<ul>
<li>You showed initiative</li>
<li>You demonstrated async communication</li>
<li>You turned a constraint (time zones) into an advantage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your turn:</strong></p>
<p>Think of ONE story where you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Solved a problem independently</li>
<li>Communicated clearly without face-to-face interaction</li>
<li>Made a decision without waiting for approval</li>
</ul>
<p>Write it down. Practice it. Use it in your next interview.</p>
<p>This is the difference between &quot;I worked from home during COVID&quot; and &quot;I know how to thrive in remote environments.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>What&#39;s next?</strong></p>
<p>You have the roadmap. You have the resume tips. You have the interview framework.</p>
<p>Now it&#39;s about execution.</p>
<p>If you want hands-on help — someone to review your resume, practice interviews with you, and hold you accountable through the entire process — that&#39;s exactly what I do inside <strong>Remote Career Accelerator</strong>.</p>
<p>We start a new cohort on [DATE]. If you&#39;re serious about landing a remote role in the next 90 days, <a href="#">book a free clarity call here</a>.</p>
<p>Either way, you&#39;ve got this.</p>

<p><strong>[DOWNLOAD BUTTON: Get Your Cheat Sheet]</strong></p>
<p>Quick tip before you go:</p>
<p>The #1 thing that separates good remote candidates from great ones?</p>
<p><strong>They ask better questions.</strong></p>
<p>At the end of every interview, you&#39;ll hear: &quot;Do you have any questions for us?&quot;</p>
<p>Most people ask generic stuff: &quot;What&#39;s the culture like?&quot; &quot;What&#39;s a typical day?&quot;</p>
<p>Top candidates ask questions that prove they understand remote work:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;How does the team handle asynchronous communication?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What does success look like in the first 90 days for this role?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;How do you approach performance reviews in a remote environment?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions signal: <em>I&#39;m not just looking for any job. I&#39;m evaluating if this is the right remote environment for me.</em></p>
<p>I&#39;ll send you 12 more questions like this on Wednesday.</p>

<li>The question that makes hiring managers remember you</li>
<li>{{FirstName}}, ask this at the end of every interview</li>
<li>12 questions that prove you &quot;get&quot; remote work</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>As promised — here are 12 interview questions that make you stand out:</p>
<p><strong>Questions about communication:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;How does your team handle knowledge sharing and documentation?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What tools do you use for async updates?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;How do you ensure remote employees don&#39;t get overlooked for promotions?&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Questions about culture:</strong><br>4. &quot;What does &#39;flexible schedule&#39; actually mean here?&quot;<br>5. &quot;How do you build team connection without an office?&quot;<br>6. &quot;What&#39;s your approach to work-life boundaries?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Questions about performance:</strong><br>7. &quot;How do you measure productivity in remote roles?&quot;<br>8. &quot;What does high performance look like in this position?&quot;<br>9. &quot;How do you handle feedback and coaching remotely?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Questions about the role:</strong><br>10. &quot;What&#39;s the biggest challenge the last person in this role faced?&quot;<br>11. &quot;How has this role evolved since going remote?&quot;<br>12. &quot;What would make someone wildly successful in this position?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> Pick 3-4 based on what you actually want to know. Don&#39;t just rattle them off.</p>
<p>The goal isn&#39;t to sound smart. It&#39;s to have a real conversation about whether this role is right for you.</p>

<p>Last thing before I let you go:</p>
<p>Most candidates send weak thank-you emails. &quot;Thanks for your time. I&#39;m very interested. Looking forward to hearing from you.&quot;</p>
<p>Forgettable.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s a better approach:</strong></p>

<p>One thing I forgot to mention: [Add a relevant insight, example, or resource].</p>
<p>For example, when you mentioned [specific challenge], it reminded me of a similar situation at {{Company}} where I [brief story showing relevant skill]. Happy to share more about that approach if it&#39;s helpful.</p>
<p>Either way, I&#39;m excited about the opportunity and looking forward to next steps.</p>

<p>Instead:</p>

<li><strong>Pick 10 companies</strong> that align with your skills and values</li>
<li><strong>Research each one</strong> (read their blog, follow their team on LinkedIn)</li>
<li><strong>Personalize your outreach</strong> (I&#39;ll show you how in my next email)</li>

<li>The networking mistake that kills your chances</li>
<li>Why your LinkedIn outreach isn&#39;t working</li>
<li>{{FirstName}}, stop doing this on LinkedIn</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Quick one today.</p>
<p>I see this mistake constantly:</p>
<p>People send great LinkedIn messages... then immediately ask for a job.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#39;t do this.</strong></p>
<p>Networking isn&#39;t about getting hired on the spot. It&#39;s about building relationships that <em>lead</em> to opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Better approach:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Connect with people at companies you&#39;re interested in</li>
<li>Engage with their content (comment thoughtfully on posts)</li>
<li>Ask for insights, not jobs (&quot;What do you love about working there?&quot;)</li>
<li>Stay in touch (follow up every few weeks with value — articles, intros, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Hey {{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Your salary negotiation scripts are ready:</p>
<p><strong>[DOWNLOAD BUTTON: Get Your Scripts]</strong></p>
<p>Here&#39;s the truth about negotiating remote roles:</p>
<p><strong>Companies expect you to negotiate.</strong> If you don&#39;t, they assume you don&#39;t know your value.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve helped clients negotiate an average of $14K more in base salary (plus better benefits, equity, and flexibility).</p>
<p>The scripts you just downloaded cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to respond to &quot;What&#39;s your salary expectation?&quot;</li>
<li>How to counter a lowball offer</li>
<li>How to negotiate equity, PTO, and remote work stipends</li>
</ul>
<p>Read through them this weekend.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Let&#39;s talk about why negotiation feels uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Most people think: <em>&quot;I don&#39;t want to seem greedy. What if they pull the offer?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Here&#39;s the reality:</p>
<p><strong>You&#39;re not asking for a favor. You&#39;re discussing fair compensation for the value you&#39;ll create.</strong></p>
<p>Companies don&#39;t pull offers because you negotiate. They pull offers if you&#39;re rude, unreasonable, or dishonest.</p>
<p>Negotiating professionally? That makes you <em>more</em> attractive, not less.</p>
<p><strong>Mindset shift:</strong></p>
<p>Instead of: &quot;Can I ask for more money?&quot;<br>Think: &quot;What&#39;s the fair market rate for someone with my skills solving this problem?&quot;</p>
<p>Instead of: &quot;I hope they say yes.&quot;<br>Think: &quot;Let&#39;s have a conversation about creating a win-win arrangement.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The companies that won&#39;t negotiate?</strong> You don&#39;t want to work there anyway. If they undervalue you before you start, they&#39;ll undervalue you every day after.</p>
<p>On Saturday, I&#39;m sending you real examples from my clients who negotiated $10K-$30K more.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>David (Software Engineer):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Initial offer: $95K + standard benefits</li>
<li>After negotiation: $105K + 4 weeks PTO + $2K/year remote work stipend</li>
<li>What he said: &quot;I didn&#39;t even ask for more money at first — I asked what flexibility they had. They offered more across the board.&quot;</li>

<li>Initial offer: $88K</li>
<li>After negotiation: $98K + equity + 6-month sabbatical option</li>

</ul>

<li>Did their research (knew market rates)</li>

<p><strong>[DOWNLOAD BUTTON: Get Your Setup Guide]</strong></p>
<p>Quick story:</p>
<p>When I first started working remotely, I worked from my couch with my laptop trackpad.</p>
<p>Bad idea.</p>
<p>I was slow, uncomfortable, and burned out in 3 months.</p>
<p>Then I invested $800 in proper equipment (desk, monitor, keyboard, lighting). My productivity tripled. My back pain disappeared. And I actually started enjoying work again.</p>
<p>The guide you just downloaded covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Essential equipment (and what to skip)</li>
<li>Software tools that make remote work seamless</li>
<li>Daily routines that prevent burnout</li>

</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Let&#39;s talk routines.</p>
<p>The biggest mistake remote workers make? Treating it like office work... at home.</p>
<p>They sit at their desk from 9-5, skip breaks, and wonder why they&#39;re exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what works better:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Morning:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start with a &quot;commute replacement&quot; (walk, workout, or coffee ritual)</li>
<li>Review priorities before opening email</li>
<li>Tackle your hardest task first (deep work when your brain is fresh)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Midday:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Actual lunch break (away from your desk)</li>
<li>Quick walk or stretch (resets your focus)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Afternoon:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Meetings and collaboration</li>
<li>Admin tasks and email</li>
<li>End-of-day shutdown ritual (close laptop, change clothes, signal to your brain that work is over)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The key:</strong> Create boundaries that replace the natural separation you had with an office.</p>
<p>Without them, work bleeds into life. With them, you&#39;re more productive AND more present.</p>
<p>Try this structure for one week. Adjust based on what works for you.</p>

<li>Why &quot;just apply online&quot; doesn&#39;t work anymore</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get something out of the way:</p>
<p>Most remote job advice is terrible.</p>
<p>&quot;Just apply to 100 jobs.&quot;<br>&quot;Optimize your resume with keywords.&quot;<br>&quot;Be persistent.&quot;</p>
<p>Here&#39;s what actually happens when you do that:</p>
<p>You spend 40 hours applying to jobs. You get 2 interviews. Neither goes anywhere. You feel defeated.</p>
<p><strong>The real problem?</strong></p>
<p>Remote hiring is fundamentally different from traditional hiring.</p>
<p>Companies hiring remote workers aren&#39;t just looking for skills. They&#39;re looking for people who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communicate clearly in writing</li>
<li>Take ownership without micromanagement</li>
<li>Understand asynchronous work</li>
</ul>
<p>If your resume and application don&#39;t SHOW these qualities, you&#39;ll get filtered out — even if you&#39;re qualified.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s the shift:</strong></p>
<p>Stop &quot;applying to jobs&quot; and start &quot;demonstrating remote readiness.&quot;</p>
<p>In my next email (Thursday), I&#39;ll show you exactly how to do this — with real examples from people who went from 0 interviews to multiple offers in 6 weeks.</p>

<li>From 0 interviews to 3 offers (here&#39;s how)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Let me tell you about James.</p>
<p>When he came to me, he&#39;d been applying to remote jobs for 4 months. He&#39;d sent out 150+ applications. He&#39;d gotten 3 interviews.</p>
<p>Zero offers.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what we changed:</strong></p>
<p>Instead of spraying applications everywhere, we:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Identified 15 target companies</strong> (where his skills were a perfect fit)</li>
<li><strong>Rebuilt his LinkedIn</strong> (to position him as &quot;already remote-ready&quot;)</li>
<li><strong>Used direct outreach</strong> (connecting with hiring managers, not just applying online)</li>
</ol>
<p>Within 6 weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 conversations with hiring managers</li>
<li>7 formal interviews</li>
<li>3 offers</li>
</ul>
<p>He took the highest one: $118K, fully remote, unlimited PTO.</p>
<p><strong>The difference?</strong></p>
<p>Strategy &gt; volume.</p>
<p><strong>Want the same results?</strong></p>
<p>I can&#39;t promise you&#39;ll land a job in 6 weeks (everyone&#39;s situation is different).</p>
<p>But I CAN promise this: If you follow a proven system, you&#39;ll get results faster than &quot;spray and pray.&quot;</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Pop quiz:</p>
<p>When was the last time you updated your LinkedIn?</p>
<p>If the answer is &quot;uh... not recently,&quot; you&#39;re leaving money on the table.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s why:</p>
<p><strong>60% of remote job offers start with a recruiter reaching out on LinkedIn.</strong></p>
<p>Not you applying. THEM contacting YOU.</p>
<p>But only if your profile shows you&#39;re remote-ready.</p>
<p><strong>3 quick fixes:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Headline:</strong> Stop saying &quot;Marketing Manager at XYZ Corp.&quot;<br>Start saying: &quot;Marketing Manager | Helping SaaS Companies Scale | Remote Work Advocate&quot;</p>
<p><strong>2. About section:</strong> Add a line like this:<br>&quot;I&#39;ve been working in distributed teams since 2020 and have developed strong skills in async communication, self-management, and cross-functional collaboration.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>3. Featured section:</strong> Add examples of your work (presentations, articles, portfolio pieces)</p>
<p>These tweaks take 20 minutes. They signal: &quot;I&#39;m not just looking for remote work. I&#39;m built for it.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Bonus:</strong></p>
<p>If you REALLY want to stand out, post on LinkedIn 2-3x/week. Share insights from your industry. Comment on other people&#39;s posts.</p>
<p>Recruiters notice people who show up consistently.</p>

<p><strong>People undersell their remote-readiness.</strong></p>
<p>They have relevant experience. They&#39;ve worked on distributed teams. They&#39;ve used collaboration tools.</p>
<p>But they don&#39;t SAY it.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Instead of: &quot;Managed team of 8&quot;<br>Say: &quot;Led remote team of 8 across 4 time zones using Slack, Asana, and weekly async check-ins&quot;</p>
<p>See the difference?</p>
<p>One is generic. The other screams: &quot;I already know how to do this.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Your homework:</strong></p>
<p>Go through your resume and LinkedIn. For every bullet point, ask:</p>
<p>&quot;Does this show I can thrive in a remote environment?&quot;</p>
<p>If not, rewrite it.</p>
<p>This one change can 3x your interview rate.</p>

<p>✅ &quot;I&#39;ve found I&#39;m more productive in remote environments because I can design my workday around deep focus time.&quot;</p>
<p>✅ &quot;I believe remote work forces better communication habits — clear documentation, async updates, and intentional collaboration.&quot;</p>
<p>✅ &quot;I&#39;ve worked with distributed teams before and saw firsthand how removing geographic constraints leads to better talent and more diverse perspectives.&quot;</p>
<p>See the difference?</p>
<p>You&#39;re not just saying &quot;remote is nice for me.&quot; You&#39;re saying &quot;remote makes me a better employee.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong></p>
<p>Follow up with a story that proves your answer.</p>
<p>Example:<br>&quot;At {{Company}}, I was the only designer working with a dev team in a different timezone. Instead of waiting for meetings, I started using Loom to record walkthroughs. It cut our feedback loop from 2 days to 2 hours.&quot;</p>

<li>The remote work skill nobody talks about</li>
<li>{{FirstName}}, this is what separates good from great</li>
<li>Why async communication is your superpower</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>Hey {{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Let&#39;s talk about the skill that matters most in remote work:</p>
<p><strong>Asynchronous communication.</strong></p>
<p>Most people think remote work is about Zoom calls and Slack messages.</p>
<p>But the best remote workers? They communicate in a way that doesn&#39;t require everyone to be online at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Why this matters:</strong></p>
<p>When you work across time zones (or just have different schedules), synchronous communication becomes a bottleneck.</p>
<p>Waiting for someone to respond? That&#39;s lost productivity.</p>
<p><strong>What async communication looks like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Documenting decisions in Notion instead of assuming everyone remembers the meeting</li>
<li>Recording a 3-minute Loom video instead of scheduling a 30-minute call</li>
<li>Writing detailed project updates instead of &quot;quick sync?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The result?</strong></p>
<p>You&#39;re less dependent on other people&#39;s schedules. You move faster. And you become known as someone who &quot;just gets it.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Your turn:</strong></p>
<p>This week, replace ONE meeting with an async update (video, doc, or written summary).</p>
<p>See how it feels. See how much time you save.</p>

<p>Remote work flexibility is amazing.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also dangerous.</p>
<p>Without structure, &quot;work from anywhere&quot; becomes &quot;work from everywhere, all the time.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s the system that works:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Time-block your calendar</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t just have a to-do list. Assign every task a specific time block.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul>
<li>9-11am: Deep work (no Slack, no email)</li>
<li>11-12pm: Meetings</li>
<li>1-3pm: Collaborative work</li>
<li>3-4pm: Admin and email</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Create start and end rituals</strong></p>
<p>Without a commute, you need artificial boundaries.</p>
<p>Start: 10-minute walk or coffee ritual<br>End: Shut laptop, change clothes, signal to your brain that work is over</p>
<p><strong>3. Protect your deep work time</strong></p>
<p>Turn off Slack notifications. Close email. Put your phone in another room.</p>
<p>Even 2 hours of uninterrupted focus beats 6 hours of distracted multitasking.</p>
<p>Try this system for one week. Adjust based on what works for you.</p>

<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Real talk:</p>
<p>The hardest part of remote work isn&#39;t the work.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the boundaries.</p>
<p>When your office is your living room, everyone assumes you&#39;re &quot;available.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>Your partner asks you to run errands mid-day</li>
<li>Your kids interrupt your calls</li>
<li>Your friends text &quot;you&#39;re home, right? Can you help me move?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You need to set expectations early:</strong></p>
<p><strong>With family:</strong><br>&quot;I&#39;m working from home, but I&#39;m not home. From 9-5, treat me like I&#39;m at an office. I&#39;ll let you know when I&#39;m available.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>With friends:</strong><br>&quot;I love that we can connect during the day, but I keep strict work hours. Let&#39;s catch up after 5.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>With yourself:</strong><br>&quot;Work ends at [TIME]. After that, I&#39;m off. No email. No Slack. I&#39;ll deal with it tomorrow.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>The rule:</strong></p>
<p>Boundaries aren&#39;t selfish. They&#39;re essential.</p>
<p>Without them, remote work becomes a prison. With them, it&#39;s freedom.</p>

<p>One of the biggest fears about remote work:</p>
<p>&quot;Will I become invisible?&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s a real concern.</p>
<p>When you&#39;re not in the office, you miss hallway conversations, lunch outings, and spontaneous collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s how to stay visible (and build relationships) remotely:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Over-communicate your work</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t assume people know what you&#39;re doing.</p>
<p>Share updates in Slack. Post wins publicly. Document your contributions.</p>
<p><strong>2. Schedule 1-on-1 coffee chats</strong></p>
<p>Set up 30-minute video calls with colleagues just to connect.</p>
<p>Not about work. About THEM. What are they working on? What&#39;s challenging?</p>
<p><strong>3. Engage in company culture</strong></p>
<p>Join virtual events. Participate in Slack channels (not just work ones). Show up as a human, not just an employee.</p>
<p><strong>4. Build external relationships</strong></p>
<p>Join remote work communities. Attend virtual conferences. Network on LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Your next opportunity might come from someone you&#39;ve never met IRL.</p>

<p>Relationships don&#39;t happen by accident in remote environments. You have to be intentional.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s address the elephant in the room:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;If I&#39;m remote, will I get passed over for promotions?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s possible. IF you&#39;re not strategic.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s how to make sure you&#39;re not overlooked:</p>
<p><strong>1. Make your impact visible</strong></p>
<p>Track your wins. Share results publicly (in team meetings, Slack, or company all-hands).</p>
<p>Don&#39;t wait for your manager to notice. Tell them what you&#39;ve accomplished.</p>
<p><strong>2. Ask for feedback regularly</strong></p>
<p>Don&#39;t wait for annual reviews.</p>
<p>Every month, ask your manager: &quot;What&#39;s one thing I could improve? What&#39;s one thing I&#39;m doing well?&quot;</p>
<p>This shows you&#39;re growth-oriented and gives you a chance to course-correct.</p>
<p><strong>3. Take on high-visibility projects</strong></p>
<p>Volunteer for cross-functional initiatives. Lead a new project. Speak at a company meeting.</p>
<p>The more people know your name, the harder you are to overlook.</p>
<p><strong>4. Build a promotion case</strong></p>
<p>Document everything:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantifiable results you&#39;ve delivered</li>
<li>Feedback from colleagues and clients</li>
<li>New skills you&#39;ve developed</li>
</ul>
<p>When promotion time comes, you&#39;re not hoping. You&#39;re presenting evidence.</p>
<p><strong>The truth:</strong></p>
<p>Remote work doesn&#39;t hurt your career. Invisibility does.</p>
<p>Be visible. Be valuable. Be undeniable.</p>

<li>The conversation that got my client a $15K raise</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Story time:</p>
<p>Last year, one of my clients (let&#39;s call her Rachel) was fully remote and underpaid.</p>
<p>She&#39;d been with her company for 2 years. She was doing senior-level work but getting paid at a mid-level rate.</p>
<p><strong>She was nervous to ask for a raise.</strong> &quot;What if they say no? What if they think I&#39;m ungrateful?&quot;</p>
<p>I gave her a script. She used it. She got a $15K raise.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s the framework:</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Step 1: Schedule a meeting (don&#39;t ambush your manager)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Hey [Manager], I&#39;d like to schedule 30 minutes to discuss my compensation and career growth. Does next week work?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Present your case (data, not emotions)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Over the past [X months], I&#39;ve:</p>
<ul>
<li>[Specific result #1 with numbers]</li>
<li>[Specific result #2 with numbers]</li>
<li>[Specific result #3 with numbers]</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on market research, the typical range for someone with my experience and results is $[X]-$[Y]. I&#39;m currently at $[Z].</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to discuss bringing my compensation in line with my contributions and market rate.&quot;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s zoom out for a second.</p>
<p>Remote work isn&#39;t a trend. It&#39;s a fundamental shift in how work happens.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what&#39;s happening:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Companies are going remote-first (permanently)</strong></p>
<p>GitLab, Zapier, Automattic, Basecamp — these companies have NO office. They&#39;re 100% remote and thriving.</p>
<p><strong>2. Geographic arbitrage is real</strong></p>
<p>You can earn a San Francisco salary while living in Bali, Mexico City, or your hometown.</p>
<p>That&#39;s life-changing wealth-building potential.</p>
<p><strong>3. Skills matter more than location</strong></p>
<p>The best opportunities are no longer limited to people who live in specific cities.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re great at what you do, the world is your job market.</p>
<p><strong>4. Flexibility is non-negotiable</strong></p>
<p>The companies that force people back to the office? They&#39;re losing top talent to companies that embrace flexibility.</p>
<p><strong>What this means for you:</strong></p>
<p>If you position yourself as remote-ready NOW, you&#39;re ahead of 90% of the workforce.</p>

<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Let&#39;s talk resumes.</p>
<p>I review dozens of resumes every month. Most of them have the same problem:</p>
<p><strong>They don&#39;t prove remote-readiness.</strong></p>
<p>You might have the skills. You might have the experience.</p>
<p>But if your resume doesn&#39;t SHOW that you understand remote work, you&#39;ll get filtered out.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s the fix:</strong></p>
<p>For every role on your resume, ask:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Does this show I can thrive remotely?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Then rewrite it.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<p>❌ &quot;Managed a team of 6&quot;<br>✅ &quot;Led remote team of 6 across 3 time zones using Slack, Asana, and weekly async check-ins&quot;</p>
<p>❌ &quot;Collaborated with cross-functional teams&quot;<br>✅ &quot;Partnered with engineering, design, and marketing teams (distributed across 4 countries) to deliver product launches on time&quot;</p>
<p>❌ &quot;Strong communication skills&quot;<br>✅ &quot;Proficient in async communication using Loom, Notion, and written documentation&quot;</p>
<p><strong>See the difference?</strong></p>
<p>One is generic. The other screams: &quot;I&#39;ve already done this. I know how it works.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s the strategy:</strong></p>

<p>Don&#39;t just list your title.</p>
<p>Example:<br>❌ &quot;Marketing Manager at XYZ Corp&quot;<br>✅ &quot;Marketing Manager | Helping SaaS Companies Scale | Remote Work Advocate&quot;</p>
<p><strong>2. Update your About section</strong></p>
<p>Add a line like this:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;ve been working with distributed teams since [YEAR] and have developed expertise in async communication, self-management, and remote collaboration.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>3. Add the &quot;Open to Work&quot; badge</strong></p>
<p>Set it to &quot;Remote&quot; or &quot;Hybrid&quot; roles only. Recruiters filter by this.</p>
<p><strong>4. Post consistently</strong></p>
<p>Share insights 2-3x/week. Comment on other people&#39;s posts. Be visible.</p>
<p><strong>5. Engage with remote work content</strong></p>
<p>Like, comment, and share posts about remote work. LinkedIn&#39;s algorithm will show you to more recruiters in that space.</p>
<p><strong>The result?</strong></p>
<p>Recruiters start reaching out. You go from chasing jobs to evaluating opportunities.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what DOES work:</p>

<p><strong>3. Ask for insights, not favors</strong></p>
<p>Instead of: &quot;Can you refer me?&quot;<br>Try: &quot;I&#39;d love to learn more about working at [Company]. Would you be open to a 15-minute chat?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Tell me about your experience working remotely.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Most candidates blow it.</p>
<p>They talk about working from home during COVID. They mention Zoom calls. They say they&#39;re &quot;adaptable.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Boring.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what gets you hired:</strong></p>
<p>Tell a story about a challenge you solved BECAUSE you were remote.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>&quot;At {{Company}}, I was the only designer working with a dev team in Berlin. Instead of waiting for synchronous meetings, I started using Loom to record design walkthroughs. This cut our feedback cycle from 2 days to 4 hours, and the team actually preferred it because they could review on their own schedule.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>What this shows:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You&#39;ve actually worked remotely (not just &quot;from home&quot;)</li>
<li>You solved a real problem</li>
<li>You understand async communication</li>
<li>You made the team better</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Your turn:</strong></p>
<p>Think of ONE story where you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worked independently</li>
<li>Communicated clearly without face-to-face interaction</li>
<li>Solved a problem using remote tools</li>
</ul>
<p>Write it down. Practice it. Use it in your next interview.</p>

<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>At the end of every interview, you&#39;ll hear:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Do you have any questions for us?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Most candidates ask boring questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What&#39;s the culture like?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What does a typical day look like?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Top candidates ask questions that prove they understand remote work:</strong></p>
<p><strong>About communication:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;How does your team approach asynchronous communication?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What does your documentation culture look like?&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>About culture:</strong><br>3. &quot;How do you build connection in a distributed team?&quot;<br>4. &quot;What&#39;s your philosophy on work-life boundaries?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>About performance:</strong><br>5. &quot;How do you measure success in remote roles?&quot;<br>6. &quot;What does high performance look like in this position?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>About the role:</strong><br>7. &quot;What&#39;s the biggest challenge the last person in this role faced?&quot;<br>8. &quot;How has this role evolved since going remote?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Why these work:</strong></p>
<p>They show you&#39;re evaluating the opportunity (not just desperate for any job).</p>
<p>They prove you understand what makes remote work successful.</p>
<p>They make you memorable.</p>
<p><strong>Your turn:</strong></p>
<p>Pick 3-4 questions based on what you actually want to know. Write them down. Bring them to your next interview.</p>

<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>You just got a remote job offer. Congrats!</p>
<p>Now comes the scary part: negotiation.</p>
<p>Most people don&#39;t negotiate because they&#39;re afraid of losing the offer.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the truth: <strong>Companies expect you to negotiate.</strong></p>
<p>If you don&#39;t, they assume you don&#39;t know your value.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s how to do it:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Say thank you (and buy yourself time)</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Thank you for the offer! I&#39;m excited about the opportunity. I&#39;d like to review everything carefully. Can I get back to you by [DATE]?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Do your research</strong></p>
<p>Check Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, and industry reports. What&#39;s the market rate for this role?</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Craft your counter</strong></p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m very excited about joining [Company]. Based on my research and the value I&#39;ll bring, I was hoping we could discuss a salary of $[X]. Is there flexibility here?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Negotiate beyond salary</strong></p>
<p>If they can&#39;t move on salary, ask for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signing bonus</li>
<li>More PTO</li>
<li>Remote work stipend</li>
<li>Equity</li>
<li>Professional development budget</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Step 5: Get it in writing</strong></p>
<p>Once you agree, ask for an updated offer letter.</p>
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong></p>
<p>Stay collaborative, not combative. You&#39;re not fighting. You&#39;re having a conversation about fair compensation.</p>

<p><strong>[REGISTER HERE BUTTON]</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to give you a sneak peek of what we&#39;ll cover:</p>
<p><strong>The #1 mistake I see:</strong></p>
<p>Most people treat remote job applications like traditional job applications.</p>
<p>They upload their resume to job boards. They wait. They hear nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Because remote hiring managers aren&#39;t just looking for skills. They&#39;re looking for people who ALREADY understand remote work.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I&#39;m breaking down exactly how to position yourself as &quot;remote-ready&quot; — even if you&#39;ve never worked remotely before.</p>
<p>This one shift can 3x your interview rate.</p>
<p><strong>Plus:</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m sharing real case studies from clients who landed $100K+ remote roles in the last 6 months.</p>
<p>You&#39;ll see their exact strategies (what they did, what worked, what didn&#39;t).</p>

<p>Hey {{FirstName}},</p>
<p>I noticed you checked out <strong>Remote Resume Reboot</strong>.</p>
<p>Smart move.</p>
<p>Your resume is the #1 thing holding you back from remote interviews.</p>
<p>Not because you&#39;re unqualified. But because it doesn&#39;t SHOW you&#39;re remote-ready.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s the problem:</strong></p>
<p>Most resumes are written for office jobs. They list responsibilities, not remote-relevant skills.</p>
<p>Hiring managers see it and think: &quot;This person has never worked remotely. Next.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s the solution:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remote Resume Reboot</strong> is a 1-on-1 program where I personally:</p>
<p>✅ Audit your current resume (identify what&#39;s holding you back)<br>✅ Rewrite it to highlight remote-readiness<br>✅ Optimize your LinkedIn profile<br>✅ Give you templates for cover letters and cold outreach</p>
<p><strong>The result?</strong></p>
<p>You&#39;ll go from being overlooked to getting interview requests.</p>

<li>Why qualified candidates don&#39;t get remote interviews</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>I talk to dozens of people every week who are frustrated with their job search.</p>
<p>They say:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I&#39;ve applied to 100+ jobs and heard nothing.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I&#39;m qualified, but no one&#39;s responding.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I don&#39;t understand what I&#39;m doing wrong.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I tell them:</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s not about experience. It&#39;s about positioning.</p>
<p>You might have 10 years of relevant experience. But if your resume doesn&#39;t SHOW you understand remote work, you&#39;ll get filtered out.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Two candidates apply for the same remote role.</p>
<p><strong>Candidate A:</strong><br>&quot;Managed team of 8&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Candidate B:</strong><br>&quot;Led distributed team of 8 across 3 time zones using Slack, Asana, and async standups&quot;</p>
<p>Who gets the interview?</p>
<p>Candidate B. Every time.</p>
<p><strong>That&#39;s what we fix in Remote Resume Reboot.</strong></p>
<p>I rewrite your resume to highlight your remote-readiness — even if you&#39;ve never worked remotely before.</p>

<p><strong>Remote Career Accelerator</strong> is $4,997.</p>
<p>That might feel like a lot.</p>
<p>But let&#39;s put it in perspective:</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1: You land a remote role that pays $10K more per year</strong></p>
<p>The program pays for itself in 6 months.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 2: You land a role that saves you 2 hours of commuting per day</strong></p>
<p>That&#39;s 10 hours/week. 520 hours/year. What&#39;s your time worth?</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 3: You avoid 6 more months of frustration, applying to jobs and hearing nothing</strong></p>
<p>What&#39;s your sanity worth?</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what my clients say:</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;I spent 4 months applying on my own and got nowhere. I joined the program and had an offer in 8 weeks. Best $5K I&#39;ve ever spent.&quot;</em> — David, Software Engineer</p>
<p><em>&quot;The negotiation coaching alone got me $18K more than the initial offer. The program paid for itself 3x over.&quot;</em> — Maria, UX Designer</p>
<p><strong>This isn&#39;t an expense. It&#39;s an investment.</strong></p>
<p>In your career. In your freedom. In your future.</p>

<li>From stuck to hired: Rachel&#39;s story</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Let me tell you about Rachel.</p>
<p>When she came to me, she was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Burned out from her office job</li>
<li>Applying to remote roles for 4 months (with no success)</li>
<li>Worried she&#39;d have to take a pay cut to go remote</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what we did:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Week 1:</strong> Rebuilt her resume and LinkedIn to position her as remote-ready</p>
<p><strong>Week 2:</strong> Identified 15 target companies and started direct outreach</p>
<p><strong>Week 4:</strong> First interview (with a company she reached out to directly)</p>
<p><strong>Week 6:</strong> Three more interviews (one from LinkedIn, two from referrals)</p>
<p><strong>Week 9:</strong> Two offers on the table</p>
<p><strong>Week 10:</strong> Negotiated the higher offer from $108K to $118K</p>
<p><strong>The result:</strong></p>
<p>Rachel landed a fully remote role at a SaaS company she loves, making $20K more than her old job, with unlimited PTO.</p>
<p><strong>Her words:</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;I spent 4 months doing this alone and got nowhere. I spent 10 weeks with [Your Name] and had two offers. I wish I&#39;d started sooner.&quot;</em></p>
<p><strong>This is what happens when you have a proven system and personalized support.</strong></p>
<p>You stop guessing. You start executing.</p>
<p><strong>Ready for your transformation?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Remote Career Accelerator</strong> gives you:<br>✅ 12 weeks of 1-on-1 coaching<br>✅ Done-for-you resume and LinkedIn<br>✅ Direct introductions to hiring managers<br>✅ Interview prep and negotiation support</p>

<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>I get this question a lot:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Can&#39;t I just do this myself?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>The answer? Sure. You can.</p>
<p>You can figure out which companies to target. You can rewrite your resume. You can practice interview answers on your own.</p>
<p><strong>But here&#39;s the reality:</strong></p>
<p><strong>DIY takes longer.</strong></p>
<p>When you&#39;re figuring it out alone, you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make mistakes you don&#39;t know you&#39;re making</li>
<li>Waste time on strategies that don&#39;t work</li>
<li>Miss opportunities because you don&#39;t have insider knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>With coaching, you move faster.</strong></p>
<p>You get:</p>
<ul>
<li>A proven system (no guessing)</li>
<li>Personalized feedback (no wasted effort)</li>
<li>Accountability (no procrastination)</li>
<li>Direct introductions (access you don&#39;t have on your own)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Sarah spent 4 months applying on her own. She joined the program and had an offer in 8 weeks.</p>
<p>That&#39;s 8 weeks vs. 4+ months.</p>
<p><strong>Time is your most valuable asset.</strong></p>
<p>Every week you spend in a job you hate is a week you can&#39;t get back.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been getting my emails for a while now.</p>
<p>You know remote work is possible. You know there are jobs out there.</p>

<p>Let me guess:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;I don&#39;t have remote experience.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Neither did 90% of my clients when they started. We positioned their existing experience as remote-relevant.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;I&#39;m worried about taking a pay cut.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>My clients make an average of $12K MORE in their remote roles (compared to their last office job).</p>
<p><strong>&quot;I don&#39;t know where to start.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>That&#39;s exactly why the program exists. I give you a step-by-step roadmap.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m qualified.&quot;</strong></p>
<p>If you have professional experience and transferable skills, you&#39;re qualified. We just need to position you correctly.</p>
<p><strong>The truth?</strong></p>
<p>The only thing holding you back is the decision to commit.</p>
<p>You can keep doing what you&#39;ve been doing (and hope it works eventually).</p>
<p>Or you can get help from someone who&#39;s done this hundreds of times.</p>

</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Most of my programs are designed for mid-level professionals.</p>
<p>But I also work with a small group of executives and senior leaders who want to transition to high-paying remote roles without sacrificing compensation or career trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>This is different from my standard programs.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Executive Remote Placement</strong> is a 6-month, white-glove service where I personally:</p>
<p>✅ Position you for $150K-$300K+ remote executive roles<br>✅ Connect you directly with C-suite and hiring decision-makers<br>✅ Manage your entire job search (you focus on interviews, I handle everything else)<br>✅ Negotiate offers on your behalf</p>
<p><strong>This is for you if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You&#39;re currently making $120K+ and want to maintain (or increase) your comp</li>
<li>You&#39;re in a director, VP, or C-level role</li>
<li>You want location freedom without career sacrifice</li>
<li>You value discretion and personalized service</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Investment:</strong> Starting at $15,000 (custom pricing based on scope)</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t for everyone. It&#39;s for executives who want results, not DIY courses.</p>
<p><strong>[BOOK A PRIVATE CONSULTATION BUTTON]</strong></p>

<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Let me explain what makes <strong>Executive Remote Placement</strong> different from traditional recruiting or career coaching.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional recruiters:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Work on commission (they get paid when you get hired, so they push you toward any offer)</li>
<li>Focus on speed, not fit</li>
<li>Don&#39;t care about your long-term career trajectory</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Career coaches:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Teach you strategies but don&#39;t do the work</li>
<li>Don&#39;t have direct relationships with hiring decision-makers</li>
<li>Can&#39;t guarantee access to executive-level opportunities</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Executive Remote Placement:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I work for YOU (not the company)</li>
<li>I manage your entire search (you focus on showing up to interviews)</li>
<li>I have direct relationships with founders, CEOs, and hiring executives</li>
<li>I negotiate on your behalf (average increase: $22K over initial offer)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What this looks like in practice:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Month 1:</strong> Positioning (resume, LinkedIn, executive brand)<br><strong>Month 2-4:</strong> Direct outreach and introductions (I connect you with decision-makers)<br><strong>Month 5-6:</strong> Interviews and negotiations (I prep you and negotiate offers)</p>
<p><strong>The result:</strong></p>
<p>You land an executive remote role that aligns with your skills, values, and compensation expectations.</p>

<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>

<p>Let me tell you about Michael.</p>
<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VP of Product at a Series B startup</li>
<li>Making $180K + equity</li>
<li>Burned out, wanted remote flexibility</li>
<li>Worried about finding executive-level remote roles</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Challenge:</strong></p>
<p>Michael had been passively looking for 6 months. He&#39;d applied to a few roles but got nowhere.</p>
<p>Why? Because executive roles aren&#39;t posted on job boards. They&#39;re filled through relationships and referrals.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what we did:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Month 1:</strong> Rebuilt his executive brand (LinkedIn, personal website, thought leadership)</p>
<p><strong>Month 2:</strong> Direct outreach to 30 founders and CEOs in his target industries</p>
<p><strong>Month 3:</strong> 8 executive conversations, 4 formal interviews</p>
<p><strong>Month 4:</strong> 2 offers on the table</p>
<p><strong>The result:</strong></p>
<p>Michael accepted a VP of Product role at a fully remote company:</p>
<ul>
<li>$220K base + equity</li>
<li>100% remote (work from anywhere)</li>
<li>Unlimited PTO</li>
<li>4-day work week (optional)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>His words:</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;I spent 6 months trying to do this on my own and got nowhere. I hired [Your Name] and had two offers in 4 months. The ROI was 10x.&quot;</em></p>

<li>The #1 mistake new members make</li>
<li>{{FirstName}}, don&#39;t fall into this trap</li>
<li>How to get the most out of this program</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Quick tip as you&#39;re getting started:</p>
<p><strong>The #1 mistake new members make?</strong></p>
<p>They consume content but don&#39;t take action.</p>
<p>They watch videos. They read resources. They THINK about making changes.</p>
<p>But they don&#39;t actually DO anything.</p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s the truth:</strong></p>
<p>Information without implementation is useless.</p>
<p><strong>What to do instead:</strong></p>
<p>After every lesson or module, take ONE action immediately.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Watched the resume training? Rewrite one bullet point.</li>
<li>Learned about LinkedIn outreach? Send one message.</li>
<li>Got interview tips? Practice one answer out loud.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Small actions compound into big results.</strong></p>
<p>You don&#39;t need to be perfect. You just need to start.</p>
<p><strong>Your homework this week:</strong></p>
<p>Complete your first module and take ONE action based on what you learned.</p>
<p>Then tell me about it in Slack or via email. I want to hear your progress.</p>
<p>Keep going,<br>[Your Name]</p>

<li>The secret to getting hired faster</li>
<li>Why some people get results (and others don&#39;t)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Body:</strong></p>
<p>{{FirstName}},</p>
<p>Let me tell you the difference between people who land remote jobs in 60 days vs. 6 months:</p>
<p><strong>Accountability.</strong></p>
<p>The people who move fast:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set weekly goals</li>
<li>Track their progress</li>
<li>Show up to calls and community check-ins</li>
<li>Ask for help when they&#39;re stuck</li>
</ul>
<p>The people who struggle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consume content but don&#39;t implement</li>
<li>Work in isolation</li>
<li>Make excuses instead of adjustments</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Which one are you going to be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Here&#39;s what I want you to do this week:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Set 3 specific goals for the next 7 days (e.g., &quot;Send 5 LinkedIn messages,&quot; &quot;Apply to 3 companies,&quot; &quot;Practice interview answer for remote work question&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Post them in the Slack community (or reply to this email)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Report back next week on your progress</p>
</li>
</ol>
