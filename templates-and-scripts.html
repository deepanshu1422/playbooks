<h3>Email 2: Day 3 - The Big Mistake</h3>
<pre><code>Subject: Why you&#39;re not getting remote interviews (harsh truth)

[NAME],

Let me be blunt:

You&#39;re not getting remote interviews because you&#39;re doing what everyone else is doing.

• Applying on LinkedIn ✅ (along with 500+ other applicants)
• Using a generic resume ✅ (looks identical to everyone else&#39;s)
• Setting your profile to &quot;Open to remote&quot; ✅ (screams desperation)

Meanwhile, the professionals landing $100K+ remote roles?

They&#39;re NOT doing any of that.

They&#39;re using the &quot;Hidden Market Strategy&quot; I teach in my programs.

Here&#39;s how it works:

TRADITIONAL JOB SEARCH:
→ Apply to 100+ jobs online
→ Compete with 500+ applicants per role
→ Wait weeks for (maybe) a response
→ Get ghosted 90% of the time

HIDDEN MARKET STRATEGY:
→ Identify 20 target companies (not job postings)
→ Find decision-makers on LinkedIn
→ Send strategic DMs (templates included in my program)
→ Get warm intros from your network
→ Interview for roles that never get posted

The difference?

Traditional = 1-2% response rate
Hidden Market = 30-40% response rate

Why does this work?

Because companies hiring for senior remote positions don&#39;t WANT 1,000 applicants.

They want 3-5 highly qualified candidates.

So they hire through referrals, DMs, and recruiter networks.

THIS is what I teach in the 6-Figure Remote Career Accelerator.

Otherwise, stay tuned. More free value coming tomorrow.

<h3>Email 3: Day 5 - Investment Question</h3>
<pre><code>Subject: Let me ask you something (honest answer only)

[NAME],

Quick question:

If I could GUARANTEE you&#39;d land a $120,000 remote role in the next 90 days...

What would that be worth to you?

Think about it:

$120K/year = $10,000/month

Let&#39;s say you&#39;re currently at $75K = $6,250/month

Difference = $3,750/month

That&#39;s $45,000 more in year 1 alone.

Over 5 years? $225,000.

Now here&#39;s my question:

Would you invest $6,000 TODAY to gain $225,000 over 5 years?

That&#39;s a 37X return on investment.

Most people say: &quot;Of course! That&#39;s a no-brainer.&quot;

But when it comes time to actually invest...

They hesitate.
They &quot;need to think about it.&quot;
They &quot;need to talk to their spouse.&quot;
They &quot;need to see if it&#39;s the right time.&quot;

And 6 months later? They&#39;re still in the same job, making the same salary, having the same frustrations.

Here&#39;s the truth:

The reason you haven&#39;t landed a 6-figure remote role yet isn&#39;t because you&#39;re not qualified.

It&#39;s because you don&#39;t have the right SYSTEM.

And you can either:

OPTION A: Figure it out yourself (takes 12-18 months of trial and error)

OPTION B: Follow a proven system (takes 90 days with expert guidance)

If you choose Option B, here&#39;s the link:
[APPLICATION LINK]

If you choose Option A, I respect that. Keep following my free content and you&#39;ll get there eventually.

But if you&#39;re tired of waiting and ready to accelerate...

You know what to do.

Your move,
[Your Name]

P.S. This isn&#39;t a sales pitch. It&#39;s a reality check. You either believe in yourself enough to invest, or you don&#39;t. Which is it?

<h3>Ad #1: Premium Positioning</h3>

Tired of watching junior employees land remote roles while you&#39;re stuck in the office?

[PRIMARY TEXT]
You have 10+ years of experience.
You earn $80,000+.
You&#39;re a proven professional.

Here&#39;s the truth they won&#39;t tell you:

Remote experience ISN&#39;T required.

The right POSITIONING is.

I&#39;ve helped 500+ senior professionals land $100K-$200K remote roles in 90 days or less.

No endless applications.
No salary cuts.
No &quot;entry-level remote&quot; BS.

<h3>Ad #3: Objection Pre-Emption</h3>
<pre><code>[HEADLINE]
&quot;But I don&#39;t have remote experience...&quot;

[PRIMARY TEXT]
That&#39;s the #1 objection I hear from senior professionals.

&quot;I have 15 years of experience, but no remote work.&quot;
&quot;Won&#39;t that disqualify me?&quot;

Short answer: No.

Long answer:

Remote experience is NOT what hiring managers care about.

They care about:
✅ Can you deliver results independently?
✅ Do you have strong communication skills?
✅ Have you managed projects/teams remotely (even partially)?
✅ Are you self-motivated and organized?

If you&#39;ve been successful in your career for 5+ years, you ALREADY have these skills.

You just need to POSITION them correctly.

That&#39;s what I teach in the 6-Figure Remote Career Accelerator.

We&#39;ve helped VPs, Directors, and Senior ICs land remote roles paying $100K-$250K.

Most had ZERO remote experience.

<h3>Template #1: Premium Pricing Transparency</h3>
<pre><code>Unpopular opinion:

If you can&#39;t afford to invest $5,000 in career coaching, you&#39;re probably not my ideal client.

Not because I&#39;m elitist.

But because my program is designed for professionals who:

→ Currently earn $80K+
→ Want to land $120K+ remote roles
→ Need results in 90 days, not 9 months
→ Value expertise over free advice

I&#39;d rather work with 20 committed clients who get life-changing results...

Than 200 freebie-seekers who &quot;think about it&quot; for 6 months.

If you&#39;re offended by this, we&#39;re not a fit. And that&#39;s okay.

If you&#39;re nodding along, let&#39;s talk. (Link in comments)

<h3>Template #2: Client Win</h3>
<pre><code>Client win 🎉

[Name], a Director of Marketing earning $95K, just accepted a remote CMO role at $160K.

Here&#39;s what she did differently:

1️⃣ Stopped applying on LinkedIn
(500+ applicants per job = wasted time)

2️⃣ Leveraged warm intros
(Her network got her 4 interviews in 3 weeks)

3️⃣ Negotiated like an executive
(Got $25K more than initial offer + equity)

Timeline?

67 days from our first call to signed offer.

This is what happens when you invest in a proven system instead of winging it.

Curious about her full story?

Not everyone is ready for high-ticket career coaching.

Here&#39;s my honest assessment:

✅ You&#39;re READY if:

• You earn $60K+ currently (or in previous role)
• You have 5+ years of professional experience
• You&#39;re willing to invest $3K-$10K for guaranteed results
• You can commit to 90 days of focused effort
• You&#39;re coachable (not a know-it-all)

❌ You&#39;re NOT ready if:

• You&#39;re &quot;just exploring options&quot;
• You want free advice
• You&#39;re not willing to invest in yourself
• You expect results without effort
• You need to &quot;talk to your spouse&quot; for 6 weeks

<h2>6. SALES CALL SCRIPTS</h2>
<h3>Opening Script</h3>
<pre><code>YOU: &quot;Hey [NAME], thanks for making the time today. How are you?&quot;

THEM: [Response]

YOU: &quot;Great. So I reviewed your application before this call, and I think there might be a really good fit here. But before we dive in, I want to make sure this is valuable for both of us. Can I ask you a few questions to understand your situation better?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Sure.&quot;

YOU: &quot;Perfect. So on your application, you mentioned you&#39;re a [TITLE] earning around $[X]. Walk me through your current situation - what&#39;s working, what&#39;s not, and why you&#39;re considering remote work now?&quot;

[Listen actively. Take notes. Let them talk for 5-7 minutes uninterrupted.]

YOU: &quot;Got it. And you mentioned your timeline is [X] days. Tell me more about that - why that specific timeline? What happens if you DON&#39;T make this transition by then?&quot;

[Listen for urgency drivers: bad boss, company issues, family reasons, relocation, etc.]

YOU: &quot;Makes sense. And just to be clear - you indicated you&#39;re comfortable investing $[X] in a solution. If we decide today that this is the right fit, is that budget available now, or would you need time to arrange it?&quot;

[Listen for: &quot;Ready now&quot; = HOT. &quot;Need to move some money&quot; = WARM. &quot;Need to talk to spouse&quot; = PAUSE]

YOU: &quot;Understood. Last question before I tell you about the program - on a scale of 1-10, how committed are you to making this transition? Like, if nothing changes, where will you be 6 months from now?&quot;

[Listen for their number. If &lt;7, probe: &quot;What would it take to get you to a 10?&quot;]

YOU: &quot;Okay, great. So based on what you&#39;ve shared, I think you&#39;d be a great fit for the 6-Figure Remote Career Accelerator. Let me walk you through what that looks like...&quot;

<h3>Objection Handler #1: &quot;I can&#39;t afford it&quot;</h3>
<pre><code>THEM: &quot;I don&#39;t think I can afford $7,500 right now.&quot;

YOU: &quot;I totally understand - that&#39;s a significant investment. Can I ask you a question?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Sure.&quot;

YOU: &quot;If you land a $120K remote role - which is our average client outcome - that&#39;s $10,000 per month, right?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Yeah.&quot;

YOU: &quot;So would the first month&#39;s salary cover this investment?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Well, yes, but—&quot;

YOU: &quot;And let&#39;s say you&#39;re currently at $75K. That&#39;s a $45K annual increase. Over 5 years, that&#39;s $225,000 more in earnings. Does that make sense?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Yes.&quot;

YOU: &quot;So the real question isn&#39;t &#39;Can I afford $7,500?&#39; It&#39;s &#39;Can I afford NOT to invest?&#39; Because every month you stay in your current situation is costing you $3,750. How much have you already lost by waiting?&quot;

[Pause. Let them think.]

YOU: &quot;Plus, we have payment plans. You can do $2,500/month for 3 months. Would that work better?&quot;

THEM: [Response]

[If still hesitant: &quot;What&#39;s really holding you back? Is it the money, or something else?&quot;]

<h3>Objection Handler #2: &quot;I need to talk to my spouse&quot;</h3>
<pre><code>THEM: &quot;This sounds great, but I need to talk to my spouse first.&quot;

YOU: &quot;Absolutely - I totally respect that. Can I ask, is your spouse supportive of you making this career transition?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Yes, very.&quot;

YOU: &quot;Great. And what concerns do you think they might have that I can address right now?&quot;

THEM: [Usually: cost, time commitment, legitimacy]

YOU: &quot;Got it. So here&#39;s what I&#39;d suggest: Let&#39;s get them on the phone right now. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions they have directly. Does that work?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Uh, they&#39;re at work right now...&quot;

YOU: &quot;No problem. When can the three of us chat? I have openings at [TIME] or [TIME] today.&quot;

[If they resist:]

YOU: &quot;Let me ask you this - if your spouse says yes, are YOU ready to move forward?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Well, yes.&quot;

YOU: &quot;Okay, so the decision is really yours, and you just want their blessing. I get that. But here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned in coaching 500+ professionals: The people who &#39;need to think about it&#39; or &#39;talk to someone else&#39; are usually still in the same job 6 months later. The people who commit TODAY are the ones sending me offer screenshots in 60 days. Which group do you want to be in?&quot;

[Pause.]

YOU: &quot;Look, I&#39;m not trying to pressure you. If you&#39;re not ready, that&#39;s okay. But I want you to be honest with yourself - is this really about your spouse, or are you using that as a reason to delay a decision you know you should make?&quot;

[Direct, but said kindly. Often breaks through.]

<h3>Objection Handler #3: &quot;What if it doesn&#39;t work for me?&quot;</h3>
<pre><code>THEM: &quot;This sounds good, but what if it doesn&#39;t work for me?&quot;

YOU: &quot;Great question. Let me be direct: The only way this doesn&#39;t work is if you don&#39;t do the work. Fair?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Yeah, I guess.&quot;

YOU: &quot;We have a 90-day job offer guarantee. That means you either land a $100K+ offer in 90 days, or we keep working with you for FREE until you do. I take all the risk. The question is: Can you commit to showing up and following the system?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Yes.&quot;

YOU: &quot;Good. Now, let me ask you something else - what makes you think it WON&#39;T work?&quot;

THEM: [Usually: age, industry, lack of remote experience, etc.]

YOU: &quot;Got it. So you&#39;re worried about [specific concern]. Let me tell you about [CLIENT NAME].&quot;

[Share a case study of someone with the same concern who succeeded.]

YOU: &quot;They had the exact same doubt. And they crushed it. The system works if YOU work. So the real question is: Are you willing to trust the process?&quot;

THEM: [Response]

YOU: &quot;Okay, then let&#39;s get you started.&quot;

<h3>Closing Script (Assumptive Close)</h3>
<pre><code>YOU: &quot;Okay, so based on everything we&#39;ve discussed, I think you&#39;re a perfect fit for the Accelerator. The next cohort starts on [DATE] - does that work for you?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Yeah, I think so.&quot;

YOU: &quot;Great. So here&#39;s what happens next:

1. I&#39;m going to send you the enrollment link. You&#39;ll put down your deposit today ($[X] or payment plan).

2. You&#39;ll get immediate access to the member portal with all the materials.

3. We&#39;ll schedule your onboarding call for [THIS WEEK] to build your custom roadmap.

4. You&#39;ll start implementing immediately - within 7 days, you&#39;ll have your LinkedIn optimized and target companies identified.

Sound good?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Yeah, that sounds good.&quot;

YOU: &quot;Perfect. I&#39;m excited to work with you. Let me send over that link now.&quot;

[Send enrollment link via email while still on call.]

YOU: &quot;You should have it in your inbox. Can you open it and let me know when you see it?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Yep, got it.&quot;

YOU: &quot;Great. Go ahead and complete the enrollment now while we&#39;re on the call. I&#39;ll wait - should only take 2-3 minutes.&quot;

[Stay on call while they enroll. Reduces drop-off.]

YOU: &quot;All set?&quot;

THEM: &quot;Yep, just submitted.&quot;

YOU: &quot;Awesome. Welcome to the program! You just made a great decision. I&#39;ll send you the onboarding email in the next hour with your portal login and next steps. Any last questions?&quot;

THEM: &quot;No, I&#39;m good.&quot;

YOU: &quot;Perfect. Talk soon!&quot;

<h2>8. DISQUALIFICATION EMAIL TEMPLATES</h2>
<h3>Template A: Budget Disqualification</h3>
<pre><code>Subject: Re: Your Application

Hi [NAME],

Thanks for applying to the Remote Career Accelerator.

I reviewed your application, and while I think you&#39;d be great to work with, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re the right fit right now.

Here&#39;s why:

Our program requires a $3,000-$7,500 investment, which you indicated is outside your current budget.

I never want cost to be a barrier to your success, so I&#39;d rather be upfront about this now than waste your time.

That said, I don&#39;t want to leave you empty-handed.

Here are some free resources to get you started:

→ YouTube Channel: [LINK] (100+ free videos on remote career strategies)
→ LinkedIn Profile: [LINK] (Follow for daily tips)
→ Free Guide: &quot;The Remote Job Search Checklist&quot; [LINK]

If your financial situation changes in the future (new job, raise, savings), feel free to re-apply.

I&#39;ll be here.

Best of luck,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you know someone who IS ready to invest in their remote career, send them my way. I offer referral bonuses.

<h3>Template B: Experience Disqualification</h3>
<pre><code>Subject: Re: Your Application

Hi [NAME],

Thanks for your interest in the Remote Career Accelerator.

After reviewing your application, I don&#39;t think our program is the best fit for you at this stage.

Here&#39;s why:

Our program is specifically designed for professionals with 5+ years of experience targeting $100K+ remote roles.

Based on your responses, it sounds like you&#39;re earlier in your career journey.

The strategies we teach (executive positioning, six-figure salary negotiation, hidden market access) work best for mid-to-senior professionals.

For someone at your level, I&#39;d recommend:

→ Our free YouTube channel: [LINK]
→ Entry-to-mid level remote job boards: [LINK]
→ LinkedIn optimization guide: [LINK]

Once you have 5+ years of experience and are targeting senior remote roles, re-apply and we&#39;d love to help.

Best of luck in your career,
[Your Name]

<h3>Template C: Commitment Disqualification</h3>
<pre><code>Subject: Re: Your Application

Hi [NAME],

Thanks for applying to the Remote Career Accelerator.

I reviewed your application, and I want to be honest with you:

I don&#39;t think you&#39;re quite ready for this program yet.

Here&#39;s why:

On your application, you indicated:
- Your timeline is &quot;just exploring&quot; (no urgency)
- Your commitment level is [LOW NUMBER]/10
- You&#39;re not sure when you could start

Our program is intensive and works best for people who are COMMITTED to landing a remote role in the next 90 days.

When you&#39;re ready to go all-in, we&#39;re here.

But right now, it sounds like you&#39;re still in the &quot;thinking about it&quot; phase - and that&#39;s okay!

I&#39;d recommend starting with these free resources:

→ YouTube Channel: [LINK]
→ Free Career Assessment: [LINK]
→ Join our email list: [LINK]

When your situation changes and you&#39;re 100% committed, re-apply.

I&#39;ll be here.

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. The professionals who succeed in this program are the ones who show up ready to work. If that&#39;s you in 3-6 months, let&#39;s talk then.
